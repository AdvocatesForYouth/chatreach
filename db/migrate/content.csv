Retrograde Ejaculation ,"<p>He recovered fine from his prostate surgery. The cancer hadn't spread and he had regained his full strength. The doctor asked him if he'd had sex with his partner almost as an afterthought. He shook his head, no. ""I'm impotent."" Upon further questioning the doctor discovered that his patient got a strong erection and had even masturbated once. His patient looked away. ""But nothing came outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.. and if nothing comes out, I just don't want to do it."" </p><h3>Related conditions</h3><p>Prostate enlargement, prostate tumors, diabetes, impotence, failure to have an orgasm.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Failure to ejaculate can be related to many different causes. It can be an absence of semen production, but this is very rare. Most often the condition occurs because of retrograde ejaculation, a condition in which your semen shoots from your prostate back into your bladder instead of out your penis. You still have an orgasm, but nothing comes out. For ejaculation to leave your penis, a muscle must close off at the entrance to your bladder. </p><p>If this muscle doesn't close, your semen goes up into your bladder, rather than down your penis. At different times in your life, you may produce varying amounts of semen. This is not the same thing as failure to ejaculate. Some men do not ejaculate because they never reach an orgasm. You can have a raging erection, but no matter how hard you try you just can't cum. </p><p>This can be related to drugs (both medications and legal or illegal drugs). It may also be the result of psychological problems. You are not alone. Many men face this difficulty at some point in their lives. It can result from numerous forces -- too much stress, lack of sex drive, lack of arousal, or depression, to name a few. Some men can have an orgasm and ejaculate if they masturbate but not during anal sex. Some men can't have an orgasm when they first attempt sex with men. No matter what the cause, hopefully it will be short lived.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>No semen comes out of your penis during orgasm. No semen may come out if there is a failure to have an orgasm.</p><h3>List of causes</h3><p>Nerve injury following surgery or radiation, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and spinal chord injury. There are also numerous psychological causes.</p><h3>How is it acquired?</h3><p>Failure to ejaculate generally results from nerve disease and/or damage. When you have an orgasm, nerves tell your bladder neck to close. If they are damaged or destroyed, your muscles won't get the message that it is time to close and nothing comes out. The most common nerve diseases that cause failure to ejaculate include diabetes, multiple sclerosis and a spinal chord injury. By far, the most common cause of retrograde ejaculation is surgical or radiation damage to the pelvic nerves. It is a frequent complication of prostate surgery (for cancer or even benign tumors). If your problem is a combination of failure to achieve an orgasm and failure to ejaculate, the cause might be drugs and medication (legal or illegal) or psychological problems.</p><h3>How to treat it?</h3><p>There is no good treatment for retrograde ejaculation. If your problem is caused by a disease like diabetes or MS, anything that keeps the disease in check may help your retrograde ejaculation. If your problem results from surgery then chances are it will not improve. You should always understand all surgical risks before undergoing an operation. The possibility of retrograde ejaculation is not something your doctor should mention after your surgery. </p><p>If you need prostate or extensive surgery in your pelvis (especially some types of colon surgery), ask your doctor beforehand about the risks of impotence and/or retrograde ejaculation. At the time of surgery, it may not seem important to you, but once you feel healthy, it may be. Counseling can also help you and your partner deal with your inability to ejaculate. If your partner is distressed by your retrograde ejaculation, work to reassure him that he excites and pleasures you just as he did before your surgery. Explain that you still have a great orgasm, it's just that nothing shoots out. If you cannot have an orgasm, consider what medications and/or recreational drugs you take. This is a common cause of failure to have an orgasm. You may benefit from counseling and may require medication to help you through your difficulties.</p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3>Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions.<br /><ul><li>Just because nothing shoots out doesn't mean you don't cum. With retrograde ejaculation, you can still have sex and even an orgasm.</li><li>Viagra and other treatments for impotence will not affect your ability to ejaculate. They are two entirely separate problems.</li><li>Just because you have an erection, doesn't mean that you will be able to cum.</li></ul><h3>Prevention</h3>Doctors are learning to perform surgery avoiding nerves that control ejaculation; because of this the incidence of both impotence and retrograde ejaculation is decreasing. Men with prostate cancers or benign growths who require extensive surgery are most at risk for developing retrograde ejaculation. Diabetics and people with other neurological diseases can also have this problem.",Sex ProblemsMale Impotence ,"<br /><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Impotence is the failure to achieve or maintain your erection. Some men can initially get an erection but as they try to reach climax, their erection fades. Some men's erections are not stiff enough to penetrate their partner's anus (a mouth is usually no problem because it opens wider and does not have sphincters). This is another form of impotence.</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3><p>Like other forms of sexual dysfunction, your doctor will not realize you have a problem unless you or your partner mentions it. Once your doctor knows, he/she will no doubt conduct a series of tests to determine the cause. It is essential that your blood sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure be checked. Doctors also check hormone levels to be sure that they are normal, and will examine you for signs of circulation or nerve disorders and check your genitalia. It is also important to run through a list of all medications (and recreational drugs) you take, since many of these cause impotence. One doctor might not be aware of a medication another doctor prescribed. If all is fine, you will most likely need to visit a urologist for the next step in your evaluation - a nocturnal penile tumescence test (NPT). </p><p>And no, your urologist doesn't get into bed with you and wait for Mr. Happy to rise up and take a bow. You will be sent home with a machine that when attached to your penis, records the frequency and strength of your erections. (Normal is 3 to 5 per night). If you have normal erections, your impotence is probably caused by psychological problems. If your erections are diminished in number or are weak, you probably have a physiological cause. A good at-home test can help determine the cause of your problem. If you have that morning erection - or pee erection as some men call it, and still have problems having sex, then your impotence is probably due to a psychological problem. If your doctor determines that your impotence results from a physiological cause, a further search will be made to find exactly what is wrong.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Failure to achieve or maintain an erection. Your erection is not stiff enough to penetrate your partner.</p><h3>How is it acquired?</h3><p>Doctors used to believe that most impotence was caused by psychological problems. They now know that this is not the case, with 80 percent of impotence resulting from a physiologic abnormality and only 20 percent resulting from psychologic disturbances. There are 4 major physiologic causes of impotence, with vascular (blood vessel) problems being the most common cause. </p><p>Just as atherosclerosis (hardening of your arteries) can narrow arteries in your heart, it can also affect the arteries that bring blood to your penis. In order to get and maintain an erection, you need to increase blood flow to your penis. Narrowed arteries may bring enough blood to a flaccid penis, but they might not be able to bring enough blood to bring it to attention. High blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and high cholesterol are the most common causes of atherosclerosis and vascular impotence. An erection not only requires more blood to reach your penis through arteries, but you must also keep the blood from getting out to sustain your erection. Blood is held in your erect penis because veins constrict and prevent it from getting out. </p><p>If your veins can't constrict (a condition known as ""leaky veins"") your erection will not happen or not last. Nerves play an important role in producing your erection. Signals to your arteries and veins arrive via nerves from your brain or spinal chord. If your nerves are diseased or damaged your erections will suffer. The most common neurologic causes of impotence are spinal chord injury and post surgical destruction of your nerves (most often after radical surgery or radiation treatment for cancer). Other causes include nerve damage from diabetes, Parkinson's disease, multiple schlerosis and herniated discs. Hormone abnormalities are another common cause of impotence -- most notably in men with HIV who have low testosterone levels. Problems with your thyroid and pituitary glands also contribute to impotence. </p><p>Gay men who take steroids or estrogen (looking to fill out that evening gown) also frequently become impotent because these supplements destroy your natural hormonal balances. Drugs (either prescribed or illicit) are the fourth cause of physiologic impotence. The list is long, but some of the biggest culprits are antidepressants in the Prozac family (called SSRIs), tranquilizers, heart and blood pressure medications, depressants (narcotics, babiturates, alcohol, cocaine and marijuana) and some diuretics and ulcer medications. If you can connect the onset of your impotence to the start of a new drug, chances are you've found the culprit.</p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>The best way to prevent impotence is to keep your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol under control, and not to smoke. Impotence increases dramatically with age. HIV+ men have increased rates of impotence secondary to low testosterone levels. Protease inhibitors can raise viagra levels in your blood to dangerous levels.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p>Anal sex requires a stiffer erection than other forms of sex. The anal sphincters contract and your penis must push through. A condom can also decrease sensation and make it more difficult to maintain an erection.</p>",Sex ProblemsPremature ejaculation ,,Sex ProblemsPenis,"<h3>What is it?</h3>Your penis is a tube-shaped appendage through which you pass urine and semen, and it has two general areas: the shaft, which is made of spongy tissue that fills with blood when you get an erection; and the glans, the penis' sensitive tip which is covered by foreskin in uncircumcised men. Your urethra is the tube that runs from your bladder to the open slit or hole at the tip of your glans, and carries urine and ejaculate.<br /><br />The average erect penis really is approximately 6 inches long and has a 1.5 inch diameter. When flaccid, length is more variable with average being between 3 to 6 inches. It is impossible to predict erect size based on flaccid size.<br /><h3>What is it for?</h3>What's a penis for? Although you guys may be screaming, ""Pleasure, hello!"" as right as you are, pleasure is actually a consequence of one of the main functions of the penis: to deliver ejaculate for procreation. Passing urine is, of course its other primary function.<br /><h3>How to care for it?</h3>It's important to keep your penis clean. If you are circumcised, simply wash and dry it daily; if you're not, cleaning can be tricky. Semen, sweat, urine and other secretions collect underneath your foreskin, and the result is a white, cheesy and odorous mush known as smegma. If you're uncut, pull back your foreskin and gently clean yourself with soap every day. Keeping your foreskin dry helps prevent fungal and bacterial growth, so be sure to towel off the area before pushing the skin back down. When you urinate, pull back your foreskin first, then wipe away any wetness before pushing it back over your glans.<br /><br />Circumcision removes the foreskin from your glans. Newborns who are circumcised don't require anesthesia, since the blood flow to their penises is minimal. Their foreskin is simply pressed together, and the excess is cut away. The ends are left to heal together. Adults, however, require anesthesia because the nerves in the area are more sensitive (and the procedure, psychologically speaking, can be very unsettling). Unlike newborns, adults require sutures that sew the wound together for proper healing.<br /><br />Sixty percent of American men are circumcised, whereas most men from Latin America, Asia and Europe are not. Some people have the procedure done for religious reasons, and others do it because they like the way it looks or they feel it will be easier to keep themselves clean. If you're interested in circumcision, talk to you doctor for more specifics.<br /><h3>Myths dispelled</h3>Let's dispel a really huge, ahem, myth: A porn star's equipment is not representative of the average male anatomy. In fact, according to Dr. Albert Kinsey's work in the 1940's, most men's penises measure from 4.9 to 7.3 inches when erect. If yours works properly and gives you pleasure, there's no need to worry. Penile enlargement procedures are available, but the American Urology Association does not endorse them! They can leave you disfigured and desensitized, and should never be done for purely cosmetic reasons.<br /><br /><br /><br />",Body PartsAnus,"<h3>What is it?</h3> Commonly referred to as your ""asshole"" or ""butthole,"" your anus is the opening at the end of your colon through which you excrete bodily waste, or feces. Your feces move from your small intestine to your colon, then go past your rectum and finally leave through your anus, with the help of your internal and external sphincter muscles. You cannot survive without passing waste, so the function of the anus and related body parts is crucial. These muscles open and close to let your bowel movements pass or to prevent an embarrassing accident. If these muscles are too tight, you can have difficulty moving your bowels or having receptive anal sex.  Unlike your other anorectal body parts, your anus has nerve endings. This means that hemorrhoids or a difficult bowel movement can cause pain, while anal stimulation and penetration can bring you pleasure. When done correctly, anal sex can be very pleasing.  <br />  <h3>How to care for it?</h3> Proper hygiene is important to keep your anus healthy, but there is such a thing as overdoing it. After you move your bowels, don't wipe overzealously with toilet paper, or you can harm the skin around your anus and cause bleeding. If you want to be extra clean before anal sex, try using wet cotton balls or wipes from your pharmacy. Be sure to avoid heavily-perfumed wipes, like those made for babies, because they can irritate your skin (could this be why babies cry during diaper changes?). Perfumes, oils, spicy foods, alcohol and harsh detergents can irritate sensitive skin.  Bleeding, pain and even perforation can occur as a result of anal sex. Use common sense and stop if you feel discomfort or notice blood. Unlike a vagina, your anus does not self-lubricate, so you'll need to liberally apply a water-based lubricant for any kind of penetration. And don't be afraid to speak with your doctor about any concerns you may have. Other complications can arise that are not usually related to sexual activity:  <ul> <li>Internal and external hemorrhoids, or varicose veins of the anus and rectum;</li>  <li>Anal fissures, or tears or cuts of the anal lining, which usually result from a hard bowel movement; </li> <li>Abscess, a dangerous infection caused by sex or stool caught in the anal crypts; </li> <li>Fistula-in-ano, an infection marked by a pimple near the anus that drains pus, which can develop into an abscess; </li> <li>Anal pruritus, or itching, caused by an allergy, infection, or less commonly, hemorrhoids; </li> <li>Fecal soiling, or staining of your underwear; </li> <li>Fungal dermatitis, or jock-itch around your anus; and  bacterial dermatitis, an infection of the skin caused by shaving, rubbing or scratching. </li> <li>Your anus is a frequent site of STDs, which are hard to diagnose in this part of this body. </li> </ul> <h3>Myths dispelled</h3> If you're not out to your doctor, you might be concerned that he or she can take one look at your anus and tell that you've had receptive anal sex. This isn't normally the case. Sure, a penis will stretch you a bit, but you return to normal soon after you're done. Before you take on a large sex toy, fist, or small Toyota truck, however, do keep in mind that these can stretch you enough for your doctor to wonder about what you've been up to lately.  Problems with your anus can be very serious. If you think something's wrong, make it a priority to find a doctor you're comfortable with (see our listing), and be honest with him or her about your sexual practices. If not, your doctor might not suspect an STD, and you won't get proper treatment.",Body PartsKissing,"<h3>Technique</h3>Kissing is not just limited to a partner's mouth, you can gently butterfly kiss every part of his body in a way that will drive them to almost orgasmic bliss. But does kissing come naturally and if not what are some of the things we should keep in mind while kissing? Do check to make sure that your breath is fresh and your teeth have been brushed, there is nothing worse than kissing someone with bad breath! If you smoke, then think about not smoking for a while before a kiss or using gum or a mouth freshener, after all non smokers hate kissing an ashtray! Kissing is not just moving your mouths together, it also involves body contact, hugging and touching.<br /><br /><ul><li>Don't drool all over your partner and leave huge big trails of saliva.</li><li>Open your mouth and let their tongue into your mouth and do the same.</li><li>A gentle nibble is ok, but hard biting is nasty and a real turn off.</li><li>A Gentle nibble on the neck, ears and back of the neck is very erotic.</li><li>Don't try and cover his entire mouth with yours like a suction cup, which is just plain gross!</li><li>Don't try and stick your tongue so far down their mouth that he can't breath.</li><li>Do duel with each other's tongues.</li><li>Use your tongue to sensually trace over their teeth and lips.</li><li>Don't let your tongue act like it is searching for lost food between their teeth!</li><li>Gently hold the back of their head while kissing him.</li><li>Or run your fingers through their hair at the same time, it causes goosebumps all over.</li><li>Move your lips around and respond to you r partner when they are kissing you.</li><li>Don't just stand or sit there like a stunned mullet!</li></ul><br /><h3>Unexpected peck leads to passion</h3>This is a really cool one to try, You start off by giving your partner a quick peck on the cheek or lips. Then you move back a little look him in the eye and give him another peck with a little bit more ferocity, you slowly build up the passion and excitement in the kiss till you are in the throes of wild and very passionate kissing.<br /><br /><h3>Erotic stubble kiss</h3>This is a great Kissing technique even if your partner doesn't have stubble. Start by gently kissing his lips softly, then move onto the side of his face around the side where the stubble usually grows. Gently make your way all along the edge of the face giving small little kisses. Don't suck or slobber but just lightly kiss. It is guaranteed to turn even the most masculine guys to jelly! Practice Kissing It may sound really lame but if you haven't got all that much experience kissing someone try doing some practice. Scrunch your hand up in a fist and turn in sideways, so the knuckles are pointing sideways and you have an opening kind of in front of you. Use this as a way of kissing so it is a bit like there are lips there and just practice for a while!",Sex InfoRimming,"<h3>Physiology</h3><p>The skin around your anus is rich in sensory nerves that, when stimulated, can drive you (or your partner) wild. There are no sensory nerves for pleasure more than an inch or two inside your anus. When you gently stimulate these nerves around your anus, your sphincter muscles contract and your anus twitches. No, this isn't some type of anal seizure.</p><h3>Technique</h3><p>Gently lick the skin around your partner's anus. You can even probe gently inside with your tongue. Beware of teeth and biting because the skin, if cut, can easily become infected. If your tongue is pierced you might tear the anal lining if you aren't careful. A rough beard can also irritate the anal lining. Some people use dental dams (a piece of latex) or plastic wrap placed over their partner's anus as a type of safe sex barrier for rimming. Some, however, find that this takes away the oral pleasure and taste</p><h3>Hygiene</h3><p>An asshole will always be an asshole and you can't sterilize it. At best, you can gently wash the skin with a moist cloth to remove any fecal residue. Avoid wet tissues or toilet paper that can flake and leave unappetizing bits of paper behind. A little perfume or aromatic oil may help with smells, but they can taste bad. Oils can also damage a condom if you are going to have protected anal sex.</p><h3>Problems</h3><p>The biggest problem many people face with rimming is getting their partner to do it in the first place. Again, it isn't for everyone. If your partner is bothered by your hygiene (or lack thereof) don't get bent out of shape. Listen to what he has to say -- he might be right. You may want to wash with a mild soap and gently dry the area. Something sweet that your partner likes (honey, chocolate syrup) strategically dabbed around your anus might help get your partner used to rimming. (Again, fat-based foods can damage condoms). If you are a man, you can try and get your partner used to the idea of rimming by having him concentrate his efforts on your scrotum and perineum (the area under your scrotum). Most men will do this and if he gets into it his tongue might just drift further south. For women, it's just a short lick from the clit down that slippery slope to the anus. And for both women and men, a little arching of your back or lifting your legs in the air couldn't hurt either.</p><h3>Complications</h3><p>STDs: Rimming has a low risk of transmitting HIV. Hepatitis A and B can be spread during rimming, but vaccination will protect you from these terrible infections. Herpes can also be transmitted by rimming.<br /><br />Parasites: Parasites are a frequent complication of rimming. No matter how hard you scrub your partner's anus, you will not remove all of the parasite eggs; they are microscopic. Your partner may not have any symptoms of infection and may unknowingly pass it on to you. Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are the most common parasites spread during rimming. Giardia lamblia causes a condition known generally as giardia and it is the most common parasitic infection in the U.S. The parasite lives in your small intestine and its cysts (eggs) leave your body with your stool. If you ingest these cysts the organism will grow in your small intestine. You might not have any symptoms or you might experience upper abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea and nausea. If you have these symptoms, discuss a parasite test with your doctor. An antibiotic, Metronidazole (flagyl), cures the infection.<br /><br />Amebiaisis or amebic dysentery is another common parasitic infection passed during rimming. This parasite lives in your colon and its eggs leave your body in your stool. Although you may be symptom free, many people complain of crampy abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and fever. Doctors diagnose the infection by examining your stool or with a positive blood test for parasite antibodies. Metronidazole (flagyl) cures the infection.<br /><br />Infectious diarrhea: As with parasites, diarrhea-causing bacteria can leave your partner's colon and enter your body during rimming. No matter how hard you scrub the anus you will not sterilize it and these microscopic bacteria will be left behind. Your partner may not have any symptoms and won't know if you catch it. The most common types of diarrhea-causing bacteria are Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter. They cause crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea (can be bloody), fever and vomiting. Most often these infections run their course and go away. Antibiotics are not often recommended, except in the most severe cases or in people with HIV, because they can cause you to become a chronic carrier (someone who never gets rid of the infection and can pass it on to others; chronic carriers do not feel sick). Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat infectious diarrhea.<br /><br />Skin infections: If your partner cuts, scrapes or bites your skin, cleanse the area well with an antibacterial soap. Soaking in warm water also helps to reduce the chances of infection. Repeat this several times a day until healing occurs. If swelling, pain or redness develops, see your doctor.<br /><br /> </p>",Sex InfoAnal sex,"I told a patient who had never been able to have anal sex to buy a small dildo and practice inserting it. I promised that with time he would get used to putting things in his anus. He came back a month later complaining that my instructions failed and he couldn't even get the small dildo in. I asked to see his dildo. He reached into a shopping bag and pulled out the Jeff Stryker model. I got chest pains looking at it.<br /><p>There are two common misconceptions about anal sex. Number one: Not only gay men have anal sex. and Number two: Not all gay men have anal sex! Anal sex is not right for everyone. Some of us just don't enjoy it and/or have no desire to do it. If that's the way you feel then your partner must respect your wishes. It is rape if a man forces himself on you, regardless of your gender.<br /><br />Anal sex is also the highest risk sex act two men can perform -- and not just because of HIV. Most STDs can pass between partners during close skin to skin contact when a penis rubs against your anus -- and vice versa. Infections travel both ways.<br /><br />Recreational drugs are the number one cause of unsafe sex. When you are high, you don't think about putting on that condom. Some men think that if an HIV viral load is undetectable, there is no risk of HIV transmission. This is not true. Most studies show that your semen can have a high viral load even though it's undetectable in your blood. If you have an STD, you are at increased risk of transmitting or becoming infected with HIV.</p><h3>Physiology</h3>Your anus is only 1 to 2 inches long and connects to the rest of your colon. The colon absorbs water from the liquid waste that leaves your small intestines so that by the time it reaches your anus it is expelled as solid material It is this heightened absorptive capacity that makes your rectum so good at trapping STDs.<br /><br />The anus has two sphincter muscles, the internal sphincter and external sphincter, which control your bowel movements. These muscles are bands that surround your anus and rectum. Your internal sphincter is actually a part of the colon wall and is an involuntary muscle -- which means you can't control it. This is the sphincter that relaxes to let out your bowel movements and gas. Your external sphincter is at the opening of your anus and is a voluntary muscle. You tighten it to keep from having a bowel movement at inconvenient times and places. It also contracts reflexively (and out of your control) when something touches your anus from the outside. So, no matter how much you may want your partner inside you, your muscle will at first contract to keep him out. But like any muscle, there is a limit to how long it can contract. When the sphincter relaxes, your partner (or toy) can safely enter you.<br /><br />One important difference between a vagina and an anus (or ""mangina"" as some men like to call it) is that it will not self-lubricate; you need to use a water-soluble lubricant (no Crisco, please!). In addition to damaging condoms, oil-based lubricants can block your anal glands and cause infection. Many oils, including hand creams and lotions, also contain perfumes which can irritate your skin and cause dermatitis.<br /><br /><h3>Technique</h3>Sex between men: Because of the high risk of passing STDs during anal sex and foreplay, place a condom on your partner as soon as his penis is going to come in close contact with your anal area -- even if he isn't going to penetrate you. Put a lot of lubricant on your partner's condom-covered penis and on the outside of your anus. Beware of the ""two finger stretch"" to get ready for him because this can tear your sphincter muscles easier than his penis. I recommend that you sit down on your partner so that you maintain control while you try to take him. As soon as the head of his penis pushes against your anus, the internal and external sphincter muscles contract. You will feel a sharp pain. Stay there! Within 30 to 60 seconds your muscles will relax. You can then safely sit the rest of the way down on him. Move up and down a few times and by then your muscles will be sufficiently relaxed so you can go to any position you want. Do not stimulate your penis while you are trying to take your partner. This also sets up a strong reflex that contracts your sphincter muscles even tighter.<br /><br /><h3>Hygiene</h3>No matter how hard you try, your anus will always be an anus. You can't sterilize it. You can, however, gently wash the outer skin with a moist cloth or pad (try Tucks) to remove any fecal residue stuck to your skin. Avoid wet toilet paper or tissues because they flake and leave behind annoying bits of paper. If necessary, try to move your bowels prior to sex. I do not advise enemas or douching, which may increase the risk of HIV transmission. Enemas -- even if they are just plain water -- irritate the lining of your colon and make it easier for HIV to get in or out. The motion of the sex toy, your partner's hand or penis also stimulates colon contractions. Frequently you won't evacuate the entire liquid enema before sex, and the remainder is forced out during sex by increased colon contractions, making a bigger mess than the one you took the enema to avoid. If you feel like there is still some stool in your rectum, try a gentle washout. Fill an ear syringe with warm water and insert it into your rectum. Give a couple of squirts and hopefully you will wash out any remaining feces; the volume you put in won't irritate your colon. This small amount is also more likely to be fully expelled before sex. A towel is probably your best protection for those thousand thread count sheets.<br /><br /><h3>Problems</h3><p>Some people feel that they are too tight for anal sex and can't seem to relax enough. I am sorry to say that you may never be able to relax enough to enjoy anal sex; it may not be your thing. If you really want to try it, buy a small (finger size) dildo. Lie on your side and gently insert the well-lubricated dildo with constant gentle pressure. Again, it is important to wait until you feel your sphincters relax. Once it is in, leave it there and wait until it feels comfortable. With time and practice, your level of comfort should dramatically improve as you gradually learn to enjoy the sensation of penetration and anal stimulation. Once you can easily insert the small dildo, try the next larger size until you gradually work up to something approximating the girth of a normal penis or that mega dildo you've been dreaming about. If all goes well, you're ready for your partner. Use the small dildo as part of foreplay to ""pre-stretch"" your sphincters. For men, it can be a hot experience for you and your partner as you use the dildo to get ready. When your muscles are suitably relaxed you can safely sit down on him. Just remember boys and girls: You can't always take everything just because you want too! Some men (and some toys) will be too large to fit no matter how hard you try.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Complications</h2><br /><h3>Bleeding</h3>Bleeding most often from a hemorrhoid of fissure (tear). If you see blood, stop. Most often the bleeding stops quickly. Do not have anal sex again until you stop bleeding with bowel movements. If you have hemorrhoids, experiment with different positions to see if you can tolerate one better than the other. Many men find that when the receptive partner is on his stomach, his hemorrhoids experience less swelling and bleeding.<br /><h3><br />Pain</h3>Pain during anal sex most often results from your sphincter muscles going into spasm or from a tear. You can tear the sphincters or your delicate anal lining (a fissure). If it hurts, stop anal sex. Try treating your fissure conservatively with stool softeners, sitz baths (warm soaks) and hold off having sex until you are healed. STDs can often be present with pain in your anal area but the pain usually doesn't begin until several days after sex. Pain that begins during or immediately after sex usually results from a fissure or sphincter injury.<br /><h3><br />Perforation</h3><p>A true tear through your colon wall is a very rare complication of anal sex. A penis is pliable and does not have the strength to rupture your colon. A toy, on the other hand, can cause serious damage - especially if it is long. Your colon makes a sharp bend to the left, approximately eight inches up. </p><p>A penis can bang against this turn and you might notice a sharp pain in the pit of your stomach. It usually won't push through. A hard toy can push through and when it does, you are in a life and death situation. You feel intense pain and must get right to a hospital. Delay and the bacteria can spread throughout your abdomen. This type of infection (peritonitis) can take your life.</p><h3><br />Incontinence</h3>Incontinence is an inability to control your bowels or gas. If your anal sex is pain free, your muscles should be fine and you don't have to worry about this dreaded complication. Those who enjoy fisting or large toys can permanently over stretch their sphincters and are at increased risk for incontinence in later life.<br /><h3>STDs</h3>Anal sex is the highest risk sex act that men who have sex with men can perform. Virtually every STD can pass between partners during anal sex, and for most, penetration isn't necessary and a condom may not protect you. STDs are harder to diagnose when they are inside your anal canal and not on your penis. STDs commonly passed during anal sex include: HIV, herpes simplex, gonorrhea, syphilis, molluscum contagiosum, crabs, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis, and chlamydia. MEN: Put a condom on early -- as soon as you anticipate contact between the anus and penis. Remember that fingers and toys used during foreplay can also carry STDs between partners. A condom doesn't cover the base of your partner's shaft, his scrotum or pubic hair -- these are all places where STDs can lurk or land.<br /><h3>HIV</h3>Anal sex is the highest risk sex act two men can perform.. Your risk increases dramatically in proportion to the number or partners you have and if your sex is unprotected (whether you are inserting or receiving). One medical study published in 1987 found that anal sex with one partner increased your chances of catching HIV by three times -- five or more partners increased it 18 times.<br /><br />Although we like to think that a condom is 100 percent effective in preventing HIV, it isn't. Condoms break and can be improperly used. Semen can leak out, especially if you don't pull out while holding onto your condom as soon as you ejaculate. Precum also contains HIV and this can leak into your partner during foreplay if you don't use a condom. A recent medical study examined the risk of catching HIV from various sex acts men perform with each other. It found that unprotected receptive anal sex with a partner with HIV had a 0.82 percent risk of giving you HIV. Unprotected receptive anal sex with a partner whose status was unknown (or believed to be negative) had a 0.27 percent risk of giving you HIV. If you had unprotected insertive anal sex with a partner whose status was positive or unknown you had a 0.06 percent risk of catching HIV. But the numbers are very misleading because there was heterogeneity in per-contact risk. In plain English, that means that some men caught HIV on their first unprotected experience while others were fine after 20. Unprotected anal sex is like Russian Roulette -- you never know which shot has the bullet.<br /><br />Nonoxynol-9 kills HIV in laboratories but the amount in lubricants is not enough to kill all the HIV in a partner's ejaculate. Nonoxynol-9 has been shown to irritate the delicate lining of your rectum and may actually increase your chances of catching or giving HIV.",Sex InfoScat,"<p>When I first heard about it, I thought it was the grossest thing. Playing with shit? Then I met my boyfriend, who's a little more liberal than I am, and he said I should be open to new things. Fair is fair. I have to admit, there is something about scat -- its  kinkiness -- that keeps me coming back for more.</p><h3>Hygiene</h3><p>Feces is loaded with germs that can make you ill. After scat, thoroughly wash your hands (and other body parts that came in contact with feces) with soap and hot water. If you eat feces, rinse your mouth afterwards with a strong antiseptic mouthwash. Unfortunately, this may not help to decrease your risks of infection, though it's likely to give you minty-fresh breath.</p><h3>Complications</h3><p>Your risk of infection from scat depends on exactly what you do with the feces. Activities that put you at risk include:</p><p>Putting your partner's feces into your mouth, which can happen even if you don't eat his feces. For example, if you handle feces with your hands and don't thoroughly wash afterwards, the feces may enter your mouth the next time you eat (food), bite your nails or pick at your teeth.<br />Exposing an open cut or sore to a partner's feces.</p><p><br />Simply watching your partner defecate or play with his own feces (without handling it yourself) does not put your health at risk. Feces carries parasites, bacteria and viruses. Common infections from exposure to feces include:</p><p>Giardia, a parasitic infection of the small intestine, which may cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, fever, headache and appetite loss;<br />E. coli, a bacterium which can be life threatening;<br />Hepatitis A and B, viruses that attack your liver; and<br />Shigella, salmonella and amebiasis, infectious diarrhea caused by bacteria. Even if your partner doesn't have diarrhea, he could carry these bacteria.</p><p><br />Scat also may expose you to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). For example, feces can transmit gonorrhea to your mouth. Feces with blood in it may transmit HIV, especially if you put bloody feces in contact with an open sore or cut, or into your mouth. Incidentally, eating your own feces puts you at risk of infecting yourself with E. coli (a potentially life threatening bacterium) and other bacteria that may upset your stomach and digestive system. You may also transmit gonorrhea from your anus to your mouth.<br /></p><h3>HIV Risk</h3>Exposing feces with visible blood in it to an open cut or sore may put you at risk for HIV. Eating feces with blood in it also increases your risk for HIV. To be safe, just say no to bloody feces.",Sex InfoWatersports,"<br /><h3>Physiology</h3>Urine contains harmful wastes, including nitrogen, potassium, and sodium, filtered out of your blood by your kidneys. It is usually sterile, but if you have a urinary tract infection or urethritis, it can contain bacteria.<br /> <br /><h3>Technique</h3>A partner urinates onto you -- this is called a golden shower -- into you or you can drink his/her urine. Most likely there are many other permutations.<br /><br /><h3>Complications</h3><p>You may catch an infection if your partner has infected urine and it enters your body. A golden shower is usually safe as long as it doesn't get into your eyes, nose, mouth or other orifices. Drinking urine or having a partner urinate into your anus or vagina will allow infections to pass into your body. Having a partner urinate in your anus can irritate your colon lining because urine can contain caustic compounds. </p><p>You can develop a mild colitis (inflammation) which theoretically can make it easier to catch or transmit HIV. You will also absorb any chemicals in your partner's urine through your colon wall. The bottom line: you will absorb whatever is in your partner's urine. If you're not healthy, urine can contain substances that your body can't easily process. </p><p>If you have kidney problems, high blood pressure, diabetes or another medical problem, you could exacerbate your condition by drinking another person's urine. Drinking your own urine will only return wastes back into your blood and force your kidneys to re-filter them out. Also, if you drink your own urine you can transfer infections from your kidneys, bladder, or urethra to your mouth or throat.</p>",Sex InfoErotic massage,"<h3> Setting </h3><p>An erotic massage should be given to your partner in a setting that allows them to relax and somewhere that they feel comfortable. It is unlikely that you will have a massage table on hand, so instead try on the bed. Make sure the room is warm, by turning on a heater before the massage.<br /><br />Light some candles and burn some incense or put some essential oils in a burner to create a soft and romantic setting.<br />Put a towel down on the bed so you don't get massage oils on the sheets. f you have a stereo in the bedroom put on some soft and soothing music, something like Enya, or waterfalls or something innocuous, but soothing.</p><h3>Lubrication</h3><p>Lubrication or massage oils are very important to help your hands glide all over their body. If you are intending to have penetrative sex, then use a water based lubricant, but preferably an erotic massage should not include sex. Massage oils can be purchased from a variety of stores and often contain essential oils that not only smell good but also help the body relax and rejuvenate.</p><p><br />If you don't have any massage oils, hand cream, or even a very light olive oil can be used instead. Always make sure the oil is warm before using it, as cold oil on hot skin can feel horrible. Getting started Start off by bringing your partner into the bedroom and getting them to undress and lie on the bed. You should undress to create the full body to body contact. Warm up your hands by rubbing them together before touching his body. Cover his body in warm towels all except the place where you will start the massage. You can warm up towels by putting them in a dryer for a few minutes so they are nice and warm and toasty!</p><h3>The Massage</h3><p>The massage itself should be done bit by bit on the following parts of the body. You can try a number of techniques that are listed below and use your hands, your tongue (although if you are using essential oils don't use your tongue), a feather and even an ice cube! Pay attention to the sounds of your partner and their body, if they tense up with something then stop doing that motion and start something else!</p><h3>Feet</h3><p>Start by gently massaging their feet, as much of the bodies' tension will reside in his feet. Remember to play with each toe and also between the toes.</p><h3>Legs</h3><p>Work your way up the legs one leg at a time pushing down gently into the muscles. Moving up towards their bottom. Make sure that you keep contact with their body as much as possible and every now and then get some more massage oils to help lubricate the skin.</p><h3>Bottom</h3><p>Move onto the bottom and gently knead and stroke all the bottom including the ass itself. Run your fingers lightly over the asshole, but resist the temptation to penetrate it. This will just build the anticipation and the eroticism of the massage.</p><h3>Lower back</h3><p>Move on to the lower back, bringing your hands together at the spine and then moving outwards. Also use circular motions to this area and go all the way to the sides of the hips and the bottom.</p><h3>Upper back</h3><p>Slowly move your way up the spine to the upper back. You may also want to gently blow and even lick at the back as well, to give your partner even more pleasure.</p><h3>Shoulders</h3><p>Work the shoulders and gently knead them and roll them between your hands. Move your hands down in board strokes to the back and bottom as well all the while keeping hand and body contact between you and your partner.</p><h3>Arms</h3><p>Start by moving both hands down the arm across the triceps and down to the forearms. Try alternating between lying on him and then only having your hands touching him.</p><h3>Hands</h3><p>Massage the hands paying special attention to each finger and the in between the fingers and then start moving back up the arms tot he shoulder and neck area.</p><h3>Neck</h3><p>Work on his neck and hair and gently strokes and knead this area. Blow warm air on the base of his neck between the hair line and the skin and this will cause goose bumps all over him! Turn him over and uncover his entire front body. Don't worry if he isn't hard yet, we will come to that.</p><h3>Chest</h3><p>In broad circular motions massage his chest lightly paying attention to his nipples and gently tweak them. If you are feeling very adventurous instead of using your hands, use your tongue to gently lick and nible across his chest and up to his neck and ears. Don't bite, just lick and gently blow on the exposed skin.</p><h3>Stomach</h3><p>Move down towards their stomach, but be careful not to put too much pressure on their stomach as this can hurt some individuals. Rubs the stomach and lick and blow gently. By now they will probably have a raging hardon, but don't go straight to his balls. Instead run your hands into his crotch itself, avoiding the penis and balls for a while.</p><h3>Crotch</h3><p>Massage all the skin between his legs, around his pubic area and hair and around his lower stomach and make sure he is really turned on. Gently touch and caress his balls, with either your finger tips, your tongue or even a feather. Then slowly move toward his penis. You can do an enormous amount of things here such as gently massage the oil into the shaft and head, use your tongue or use a feather or an ice cube. Alternate between his crotch area and the rest of his stomach and chest, turning him on and teasing him slightly.</p><h3>Penis</h3><p>When you and he are ready move back down to his penis and masturbate him till he ejaculates. You can try any number of techniques, from using your mouth, to kneading the head to giving him a blowjob. It is up to you and you will know his body the best!</p><h3>The end</h3><p>At the end of the massage, lie down with him kissing and holding him in a cocoon of love, warmth and after sex glow! There are a million different variations to this massage the most common being: The FeatherUse a feather instead of your hands to massage and tickle his body and penis. The Ice cubeUse an ice cube gently on sections of his body The basic massage can be changed and varied at will and should take between 45 - 60 minutes from start to finish!</p>",Sex InfoOral sex,"<h3>Physiology</h3><p>Your mouth leads to the back of your throat, and together your mouth and throat are called your oropharynx. Your mouth and throat are lined with mucous membranes. These mucous membranes are permeable (that means let things in and out unlike regular skin) so the lining of the mouth can allow viruses such as HIV to pass through, enter your blood stream and cause infection. Chronic irritation along your gum line and the many lymphocytes (special immune system cells that HIV likes to attack) on your tonsils also make the mouth an even better place for HIV to enter the body. Mucous membranes also provide a warm, moist environment that is perfect for many other STDs, such as gonnorhea, to grow.<br /><br />Your tongue, which is a muscle with taste buds, makes up the floor of your mouth. Thank your tongue for the wonderful sensations and tastes during oral sex. It is also a very useful tool for giving pleasure to your partner. But while in the throes of your passion, remember that your teeth are capable of inflicting much harm to a delicate penis or anus. Any cuts or damage to the penis or anus can make HIV transmission more likely. You can get HIV from unprotected oral sex, but your risk is much lower than from unprotected anal or vaginal sex.<br /><br />When mastering the fine art of giving a blowjob, you might want to know something about the physiology of gagging. At the back of your throat, your nasal passages connect with your trachea. When you swallow, your trachea closes to prevent liquids and food from going into your lungs (down the wrong pipe). If something does get into your trachea, you react with violent coughing as your body clears the airway. Your gag reflex is another safety mechanism that your body has to keep your airways free of anything that can block the flow of oxygen to your lungs. When something hits the back of your throat -- and you are not in the process of swallowing -- the nerves stimulate muscles to contract violently. You gag and force the intruder back to the front of your mouth. When severe, your gagging can even precipitate vomiting. But there are things you can do to minimize the likelihood of these possibilities, which can definitely take the romance out of your moment.</p><h3>Technique</h3><p>Gagging is usually only a problem when your partner's penis hits the back of your throat. If you keep it at the front of your mouth, keeping your teeth covered with your lips, you can use your tongue to stimulate the sensitive nerves around his glans (head of his penis) and rub the base of his shaft with your hand. This should keep you from gagging, while still drive him wild. As you become more used to fellatio, you may find that you can take him further back into your mouth. You can see what works best for you, and your partner may not object to giving you lots of opportunities to practice. If you keep his penis in the center of your mouth, you can prevent it from hitting the side walls at the back of your throat (an area rich in gag inducing nerves). The thicker your partner's penis, the more chance it has of hitting the sides of your throat and triggering your gag reflex.<br /><br />Here are a few other tricks you might try. You can suck on a anesthetic throat lozenge to numb the back of your throat. Although this will decrease gagging, it also deadens many of the nerves and taste buds that provide the enjoyable component of fellatio. Sword swallowers beat the gag reflex by tilting their head back so that the sword makes a straight shot for their esophagus and not the trachea. Some men find that in order to deep throat a really big ""sword"" they can lie on their back and hang their head over the edge of the bed. This maneuver lines up your esophagus with your mouth and cuts down on gagging. Since the gag reflex is heightened when the stomach is full you might want to give your blowjob on an empty stomach -- some guys are touchy about being spewed with the romantic meal you just shared. Some men find that breathing in while they go down on a penis decreases gagging while others find that breathing out does the trick. Experiment and find out what works best for you.<br /><br />As the lucky fellow receiving a blowjob, you might want to remember a few things to keep your partner happy. If he seems nervous about having your penis in his mouth, let him control your penetration. If you force yourself deep into his throat, your penis can block his airway and he may feel like he is suffocating. If panic sets in one response may be to bite down -- to avoid this painful outcome, let him be in control. If your partner doesn't want you to cum in his mouth, then you must respect his wishes. And remember -- pre-cum contains HIV too.</p><h3>Hygiene</h3><p>Your genital area has many sweat glands that give off that musky and sometimes musty smell. For some men this is a turn on while others may take one sniff and be less enthusiastic about cozying up to your loins. If you do notice a less than pleasant aroma emanating from down there, a bit of pre-fellatio soap and water can do the trick. Just remember to rinse thoroughly to prevent a soapy aftertaste. Some perfume or cologne can help reduce smells too. Spray the perfume around your pubic hair and avoid your penis because it can leave an unpleasant taste. Likewise, beware of hand lotions that can leave a bitter taste.<br /><br />It is natural for smegma (that cheesy white collection of dead skin cells and sweat) to collect under your foreskin around your glans. This is particularly true for uncircumcised men. Wash the smegma off before sex and dry your penis thoroughly before you pull your foreskin back down. If the smegma is stuck, be careful not to pull it off because this can injure your sensitive skin. Soak it first to loosen the secretions and then gently wipe it away. If you are on the receiving end of your partner's penis and he doesn't have that fresh-as-a-daisy smell, don't embarrass him. Instead, take him to the bathroom for a little shower foreplay. You can soap each other up while working toward a sexual frenzy.</p><h3>Oral sex problems</h3><p>In addition to that bothersome gag reflex and hygiene, some men not enjoy performing fellatio. Sucking a penis may be psychologically troubling for some, perhaps because of a past history of sexual abuse or assault. Take it slow; in time it may come to be pleasurable. We've all heard the whipped cream stories, and there's a good reason for this -it really works. Coating your penis in something your partner finds delicious might just entice him to lick it away. But remember that many food products contain fats that could damage condoms if you are moving toward protected anal or oral sex. Some partners might prefer sucking your penis when it is covered in a flavored condom. They feel safer from STDs (and they are). During oral sex, avoid condoms with lubricant, as they often taste quite bitter.<br /><br />Some men are turned off to the idea of sucking an uncircumcised penis, while for others this is a total thrill. Talk to your partner if you are uncircumcised and he seems less than enthused about oral sex with your cloaked dagger. If cleanliness is the issue, a shower may solve your problem. If it's the look of your uncircumcised penis that doesn't appeal to him, you can pull your foreskin back when you have an erection. In this position, an uncircumcised penis looks almost exactly like a circumcised one and he might find it easier to dive right in (or down as the case may be). If you have a penile piercing, be careful not to injure your partner's teeth by thrusting too vigorously into his mouth. If he finds your piercing unappealing, you can listen to his concerns and try explaining to him why you like it. After some time touching and playing with it he might be more willing to pop it into his mouth.</p><h3>How risky is it really?</h3><p>But how risky is oral sex, especially if you are performing oral sex on a man and he doesn't ejaculate (cum) in your mouth? The lining of the mouth doesn't seem to be as vulnerable to HIV as the anus or the vagina, but there are often cuts and tears in the mouth, on the gums, or in the throat. Some studies have shown that saliva has enzymes that can kill the virus, but they have to come in contact with the virus for a certain length of time. These were also studies that were done in glass test tubes of saliva, not mouths. </p><p>How long is long enough? There is one study of HIV in pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) from men that were HIV-positive. Small amounts of virus were found in about a third of the cases. Is it enough to cause infection? There are no clear answers to these questions. Because the research into the risk from oral sex does not have all the answers we need, each person must make his or her own decision on what to do, and how much risk to take. This doesn't mean that you have to give up the things you love to do. </p><p>You may have to become a little more creative so that you can use safer sex tools and techniques to make those acts safer. Think of this as taking steps. Each ""step"" is a little safer. For example, if you like performing oral sex on a man unprotected, having your partner ejaculating (coming) in your mouth is the most risky. The next step would be to have unprotected oral sex, without your partner ejaculating in your mouth. The step after that would be to use a condom. </p><p>The absolute safest would be to avoid oral sex and substitute other activities, perhaps not having the head of the penis in your mouth but licking the shaft and the testicles (balls). If you do have oral sex without protection, think about what cuts or tears you might have in your mouth. If you have just had dental work or have a sore throat, this can increase the chances of infection or re-infection. Brushing your teeth (especially if you draw blood), flossing, and gum disease can all cause breaks in the skin of your mouth. This doesn't mean that you should never floss your teeth, but don't do it immediately before you are likely to have unprotected oral sex. </p><p>Oral sex performed on a woman carries a risk of HIV infection, because HIV can be transmitted in vaginal fluids. Oral-anal sex (mouth to anus, or ""rimming"") carries a very low risk of HIV infection; however, you can easily get amoebas, parasites, or hepatitis this way. For either activity, it is recommended that you use a ""dental dam."" This is a 6"" by 6"" square of latex (the same material used to make condoms). </p><p>It was originally invented for dentists to use during oral surgery, which is how it got its name. There are a range of choices you can make about vaginal sex, each of which can make it safer. Completely unprotected vaginal sex (where the man ejaculates in the woman) is the highest risk. Unprotected sex where the man pulls out before ejaculation would be safer; however, pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) can infect a woman. </p><p>Using a diaphragm with birth-control jelly may lessen the risk a little bit, and if this is all you can do, it's better than nothing. The most effective protection is to have the man wear a latex condom, which is the next safer step. For bisexuals as well as gay men, unprotected anal sex carries the highest chance of infection. If you are having anal sex with a partner who is HIV-positive, it doesn't matter if you are a man or a woman, the risk is the same. It is extremely important to use a condom - some people are using thicker condoms. I don</p>",Sex InfoWhy Have Sex? ,"<p>Why do gay and bi men have sex? Here are a few reasons:</p>Exercise, pleasure, escape, for money, addiction, want to, need to feel wanted, need to be loved, to orgasm, for fun, physical need, a bed for the night, enjoyment, attraction, natural instinct, boredom, as part of a relationship, feeling horny, influence of drugs, intimacy, it's exciting ...<br /><p>Most of the reasons we have sex are about things other than pure sex. So it's useful to be clear about what you want and why. If it's just a fuck then say so. If you really like the guy and want to meet up again, say so. When was the last time you had sex and did something you didn't want to, just to please the other person? Or didn't feel able to go up to the guy you really wanted to have sex with and ask him? </p><p>Or ask a sexual partner to do that thing you really, really enjoy? Or just negotiate something different with your boyfriend?

He or she's giving you signals that their interested in you, too. The way they touched your arm got your attention. He/she smiled the sort of smile you recognize as more than just friendly. The touching has become a bit more intimate now, and he/she wants to know if you would like to come over to his/her place. <p>You are definitely interested, but you've decided that getting it on right after meeting isn't something that works for you if you are really interested in the guy/gal. This is one of those times when avoiding the topic is likely to put you in an awkward position pretty quickly. If you want to go home with him/her knowing that sex is likely to happen, great. </p><p>If that's not what you want, better talk about it now. You might want to exchange phone numbers and make plans for later in the week. Don't let yourself be pressured into something you don't want or aren't ready for, whatever the reason. Or you've decided that you really are turned on by this guy/gal and you want to get physical with him/her. Does it matter to you what your partner's HIV status is, or is it important for you to tell him/her yours? Some men find they can't relax with someone if they don't exchange this information. Better to talk about it sooner rather than later. </p><p>If you are positive, for instance, and this guy/gal is going to react negatively to that information, it will be a lot easier to find that out well ahead of actually getting naked. If you are negative and you want to find out about status before having sex, initiate the conversation early after finding out that the interest is there. </p><p>If you know that you would be uncomfortable making love with a positive guy or gal, do both of you a favor and have the guts to talk about it with him/her. You have a right to make that decision, of course. But if you ask a question, you should be prepared to hear an answer, including one that was not the one you hoped to hear. Take responsibility for your decision and communicate it in an assertive, respectful way (""I appreciate you telling me, but I have found I can't relax around positive men."") </p><p>For many men, HIV status is less an issue than knowing that the two of you are in sync about what you've decided is safe and what is just too risky. Try keeping the conversation relatively light and -- once again -- talk about it early on. Waiting until you are naked puts you in an awkward position (literally!) to receive the news that this guy/gal won't use a condom. </p><p>If you've got concerns about how healthy it is to enjoy a particular activity with someone you've just met, tell him you'd like to wait for now. If you have decided that you really need a condom to enjoy something else, tell him/her with a smile and make it easy for him/her to agree with you.

Or take the few drinks you bought your latest one nightstand at the bar, it's still paying for it. <p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can open almost any gay newspaper to the back and see Male Escort Services listed, or under Massage/bodyworkers. Whatever it is it is still paying for play. It is illegal to pay for sex in a most all states except for a few exceptions. So escorts have found a variety of ways around it, such as calling it a true escort service and then if sex happens it is by mutual agreement by consenting adults. </p><p>The sex is not paid for, it is the company that is paid for. If you are going to use an escort, take some time and energy to find the right one and kind of escort for you. There are a few types of escorts listed below. Each type will have it's own cost structure and will have it's own risks. Many of the more expensive escorts are sticklers for safer sex, while some of the street boys or ""rentboys"" will not care so much as they are doing it for minimal money in the back of a car and can't really think past their next drug hit. </p><p>A few thoughts though about male prostitutes, not all of them do it because they are drug addicts, some are college students who do it to put themselves through college, although after college they rarely get fully out of the game. Some guys do it because they are highly sexed and they are even choosy about the guys they do it with, they might have a few regulars on a loose sort of arrangement, and this is more like serial Sugar Daddy territory! </p><p>Many however do it because they have nothing else to offer, or so they think and sex with some of these guys can be a rather disappointing experience, and risky as well.<br /><br />To find out more about escorts and their trade check out the helpful and informative website below:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.hookonline.org"">www.hookonline.org</a><br /></p>",EscortsAgencies,"Some agencies also provide them rooms such as dungeons, lockers-rooms, fairy tales etc. With escort agencies prepare to pay a premium for the service as they have to cover their overhead.

Many of the rentboys you may see are actually straight boys with nothing else left to offer themselves or so they think.  <p>To find out more about escorts and their trade check out the helpful and informative website below:</p> <p><a class=""slink"" href=""http://www.hookonline.org/resources/ftr_cg.htm"" target=""_blank""> www.hookonline.org</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",EscortsOccasional pay for play,"Instead if an opportunity arises for making a bit of money they take it.

However as more was discovered about the virus and ways to practice safer sex, the venue once again melted back into the shadowy world of the gay scene and has flourished ever since.<br /><h3>Who goes there?</h3>In reality a lot of men go to the gay sex venues, whether they are single, taken, married, bisexual or just curious. All sorts of men go, there is no one generic type and or any night or day of the week you can be assured that a wide cross section of the community may be enjoying themselves in one of these venues.<br /><h3>Is there a code of conduct?</h3>There is no written code of conduct for these venues, although each one will have a slightly different unwritten code of behavior and cruising. Men mainly cruise each other in hallways, steam rooms pools, saunas and Jacuzzi. Men do not go there as a ""social"" occasion instead they generally keep to themselves, except when they are cruising for a trick. Sex is conducted in public, private or in a variety of group or other situations. Each venue will have a slightly different theme, from Roman Baths, to S&M dungeons.<br /><h3>How do I find them?</h3>You can usually find them listed in the gay newspapers and magazines and in many places listed in the telephone directory as well.<br /><h3>Bathhouses</h3>Bathhouses are probably the best known of the gay sex venues. These places are usually quite large and have been around for a while. In these venues upon entry you are given a towel and a locker key. You undress in the locker area and then cruise through the venue. The venue may have, a sauna, steam room, private cubicles, a dark room or maze, video rooms showing non- stop gay porn and sometimes a gym.<br /><br />Men openly cruise each other as they wander through these places. When they see a person they like eye contact or a light brush of the hand is used to indicate interest. Then they may follow each other to a private cubicle or even just go for it in the corridor if that takes their fancy. Be aware that sitting in the Jacuzzi you may find yourself approached by someone using the cover of the water to make their move. If you are the object of unwanted attention be polite but firm and gently shake your head or gently remove their hand. Most if not all bathhouses will provide a steady supply of condoms and lubricant throughout the venue.<br /><h3>Adult theatres</h3>Adult theatres are incredible popular and are also available for the straight male community. They usually have a number of small theatres showing non-stop gay and straight porn. Many of these venues also have dark rooms where men can go as well. Men sit and watch the movies while other men cruise through the back of the theatres. If you see someone you are interested in, you may sit next to them (or they may sit next to you). Gentle groping can lead to full on sex in seats, or may end up in a more private setting. Not all-adult theatres have a ready supply of condoms and lube. Many provide them on entry and you will need to make sure that you have a supply before you enter. Adult theatres do not generally have showers so you cannot fully clean up after an encounter.<br /><h3>Video arcades</h3>Video arcades are usually found at the back of adult shops and provide a small booth with a selection of videos that can be played for a small amount of money, either coin or token operated. In most cases before you enter you have to buy a certain number of tokens. The booths sometimes have a ""gloryhole"" between them. While some are large enough for two people to fit in at a squeeze. Video arcades are very popular with closeted and married guys, as they are located in straight adult shops as well, so the men have an excuse for being in the store.<br /><h3>Other places</h3>There are an assortment of other types of sex venues such as mazes, dungeons and simple cubicles at the back of sex stores. They operate on the same principle as Video arcades except many may also have private booths and rooms for encounters.",VenuesTribal sex,"<p>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s well past midnight now and Richard drives off and heads downtown to his loft with William. The bass beat still makes his head pound Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only part of him throbbing. The connection he felt on the dance floor echoes within him as he and William undress one another and explore each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bodies.<br /><br />Not all sex happens within a relationship. While many men equate sex with love and intimacy, many other men do not. Men who make a distinction between sex and romantic love are looking for something else. For some it is simple pleasure or erotic relief. For others there is another quality to this part of their erotic selves Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a sense of connection to an erotic tribe of gay men.<br /><br />Tribes have certain rituals; members have ways of acknowledging one another. Some tribes are homogeneous, with everyone looking and behaving pretty much alike; other tribes make room for all sorts of members, so long as they go along with the rituals and rules. Gay and bi tribes come in both flavors.<br /><br />Miles away in Chicago, Mark is headed to a sex club he visits when he is in town. Once there he undresses and joins the other towel clad men walking the hallways. Sometimes thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nod or a smile or an exchange of pleasantries; more often there is only a quick glance. The music and smell of the place is familiar and exhilarating. To Mark it smells like sex.<br /><br />After making the rounds and checking out whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s here, Mark heads to a dimly lit room where a circle of ten men stand. All are naked. They are pleasuring themselves, standing shoulder to shoulder and urging one another on. Mark finds himself wondering why is this so exciting, when none of these men is really his type. Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being together with other men who are shameless and feeling the same thing. He begins to surrender to the building excitement.<br /><br />Separating love and sex isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always good for you, of course. Sex can become compulsive, and looking for one sex partner after another can be a way of avoiding the challenges of intimate relationships. Continually being on the hunt can mean never simply allowing yourself to enjoy feeling content. And cruising for sex can be a problem if it serves as a way of distracting yourself from other problems in life that you would be better off addressing.<br /><br />ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too simplistic, though, to make the judgment that all men who have sex in tribal/public settings are avoiding one-on-one intimacy.<br /><br />Connecting raising erotic energy with the sense of tribal bonding men feel is a powerful experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially for those of us living in communities where we can feel isolated, or where we have outgrown our familial or cultural roots. This sense of connection isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t something everyone encounters, but for those who do it can be an important experience.<br /><br />Americans are optimists and have a long history of experimenting with utopian communities that havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worked out well. In the same way, it is important for men who connect with this tribal erotic energy to cultivate an ability to reflect on their experience. Take a look. Is connecting with the group a substitute for finding a deep relationship with one individual? Does the sense of tribal connection require everyone to act and look just the same, or are men of other races, looks, abilities and ages welcome? Is there an unhealthy pressure to conform? Will you be kicked out of this seeming paradise when you reach a certain age?<br /><br />For men who are part of the erotic tribe, taking a look at safer sex practices is especially<br />important. Is any sex that takes place safer sex? Is there a place for self-disclosure, or would saying to someone Ã¢â‚¬Å“We need to use a condom, I have HIVÃ¢â‚¬Â be seen as odd? Allowing your sense of tribal connection with others to become an excuse for avoiding taking care of yourself or others with whom you connect is just another way of being in denial.<br /><br />Sexual self-expression in all its glory is something our gay male community has traditionally valued. Take time to stay conscious about your choices and the events in which you take part and celebrate your life.</p><p><br />John R.

Easy anonymous sex can be found almost anywhere for gay guys, and the fact that gay guys are quite sexually active means that gay guys have got cruising in general down to an art form. Cruising usually revolves around public toilets in shopping centers, parks and other relatively innocuous locations. Cruising is almost always illegal all over under the laws of public indecency, and being caught having sex with another guy in public can not only be embarrassing but also end up with either a fine, jail sentence or community service. Just look at the demise of George Michael who was caught soliciting anonymous sex in a public toilet.<br /><br />But if the illegality of it doesn't put you off then there are literally hundreds of thousands of places all over where you can go to find quick anonymous sex. Many of the people that frequent these places are married or identify as straight even though they have sex with men. And research has shown that they don't always practice safe sex, so if you do meet someone always practice safe sex! Common Public Sex Venues include:</p><ul><li>Shopping Center Toilets</li><li>University Toilets</li><li>Parks</li><li>Sports Club Shower/Steam rooms</li><li>Airports</li><li>Freeway reststops</li></ul><p><br />An easy way to identify somewhere as a public sex venue is to look for graffiti on toilet doors and walls as this is usually a good indicator of whether it is or not.</p><h3>How do they work?</h3><p>Guys will often stand at the urinal appearing to be taking a piss, but they will stay there for a while. They may make eye contact with you, or play with their penis in their hands. Or they may even look at you then move to a toilet stall. This is usually an invitation to follow them into the stall. At other places a guy may sit in a stall and then when you sit down in the stall next to him he may tap his foot a few times. </p><p>If you tap your foot back and then he taps in return this may be an invitation. Variations in this theme include a furtive cough, which is then returned, or even a note passed under the stall wall. Some stalls have glory holes or peepholes, which you can look through or if large enough push your penis through or have them push their penis through. Before doing that you really should make sure that it is an invitation and not just someone coughing or tapping their foot! Most guys do not speak and try to keep up the appearances as straight, and some guys are genuinely straight, but like to have their cock sucked by a guy!</p>",VenuesWhy do men bareback?,"All sex that involves opening the heart is risky to some extent. Intimacy requires vulnerability, and vulnerability carries with it the possibility of being hurt. While we usually think of our emotions as most at risk when we think of intimacy, the sense of putting our physical selves in the line of fire as well may be a craving that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully conscious. We want to be fully present during sex, and this may be one way to do it.<p>Sadly, safer sex information often subtly trivializes bi sex. Little attention is paid to how important cum is to many men, for instance. If ejaculate is discussed at all, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only in discussing ways to keep it out of your body. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treated as a small price to pay for avoiding infection.</p><p>This misses the meaning of sex for many men. Ejaculate is not some meaningless Ã¢â‚¬Å“bodily fluid;Ã¢â‚¬Â it is a powerful, mystical substance. It is in some ways the essence of male erotic energy and power. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warmth and wetness, taste and fragrance captivate our senses. To watch a man ejaculate is to see him naked and raw and unselfconscious; to feel him ejaculate is to experience the power of what it means to be a sexually alive man.<br /><br />Small wonder that when safer sex instructions imply that ejaculate is a toxic substance or dismiss its importance, men may become alienated from their own bodies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or simply learn to tune out these messages completely.<br /><br />None of this is to minimize the need to avoid HIV transmission. What is important is to make conscious, sex-positive choices that respect the sacredness of our sexuality.</p><h3>Does unprotected mean unsafe?</h3><p>Unprotected does not always mean the same thing as unsafe. Sex between two (or more, for that matter) people who do not have HIV is not going to put anyone at risk of transmitting HIV. Of course, there are other bugs out there besides the ""big"" one (HIV). Conscious unprotected sex requires that the parties involved know about their own physical health and well-being. It also requires that the parties involved be capable of telling the truth and committed to telling it.<br /><br />If some men are barebacking because they are seeking an intense and more profound connection with their partners, there are other ways of getting to the same place without possibly compromising their physical health. Some men talk about not liking the way condoms cut down on sensation, for instance. If that's true for you, think about exactly what sensations it is that you are seeking. Do you take enough time to really savor the sensations that are already present, or is there a big rush to get to one particularly sensation?</p><h3>Ejaculate and barebacking</h3><p>What place does semen play in your sexuality? Is it necessary for you to take your partner's ejaculate in your body for you to feel like your experience is complete? This can still be safe if you and your partner have the same HIV status. If both of you are HIV negative and you want to dispense with condoms, safety will require having a sexually-exclusive relationship or a clear commitment to safer sex when being sexual with other men.<br /><br />Sometimes ejaculate is a sort of shorthand for experiencing the other man's erotic energy fully. If an exchange of energy is what you're ultimately seeking, explore other ways to make that powerful connection and savor the sight, smell and feel of your partner's cum. Celebrate each other's orgasms while keeping one another safe and healthy. Be shameless; get into it. Cheer him on. And savor the powerful time after the climax, a time of hard breathing and open hearts. Don't be in too much of a hurry to tidy up.<br /><br />The conflict many of us have over safer sex practices can help us to explore more deeply just how powerful and sacred sexuality can be. In a world where bi male sexuality is often disrespected - if not actually outlawed - to celebrate our sexuality and to enjoy it in ways that keep us healthy is a powerful act of love.<br /><br />John R.

Does that describe you? Maybe not. What if you enjoy sexÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but not as much as everyone else around you seems to enjoy it? If your sex drive is lower than average, you may wonder what is wrong with you.<br /><br />There is probably nothing wrong with you. ""I'm a hell of a lot more interested in quality than quantity when it comes to sex,"" says Jim, a 30-year-old professional guy in Auburn. ""I'd rather have hot sex with the right partner once every week or two than have lots of crummy sex several times a week."".<br /><br /><h3>How much sex is enough?</h3>How much sex is enough? YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to find that answer yourself, guy. Some men find it perfectly normal to be jacking off every day and still having sex several times a week. Other men donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have that much sex in a month. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an individual thing. Some men find they just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much erotic interest regardless of whether the perfect partner is around or not. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think much about sex. Or they think about it, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care about it enough to actually act on the urge. Or they find that when they get it on, they have trouble getting it up.<br /><br />The hormone testosterone controls sex drive in both men and women (yes, women have it too). WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a normal testosterone level? Levels for healthy men vary between 200 and 1200 nanograms of testosterone per deciliter (ng/dl) of blood. Normal levels for teenagers and young adults are highest Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 800-1200 ng/dl. Some men still have 800 ng/dl levels at 70, but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusual. There is usually a decrease of about one percent per year.<br /><br />Testosterone levels are influenced by many factors. Replacement hormone therapy is available, but somewhat controversial due to unknown long-term effects. Your physician is the best source of information about all this.<br />Return to TopTop<br /><br /><h3>Major causes</h3>It's normal to have more interest in sex on some days than others. Sometimes we're distracted by other stuff and sex isn't quite as important. A sudden drop could mean a health problem; talk it over with your doctor. If you are concerned that your libido is low enough that it may be a problem, consider the major causes:<br /><br /><h3>Stress and fatigue</h3>If you've been working too hard, pushing yourself too much or preoccupied with financial worries, your interest in sex may be lower than usual. Think of the loss of interest like you would the warning light on your car's dashboard: it's there to get your attention. Maybe you need to cut back on your commitments or work fewer hours. Maybe you need to take better care of yourself.<br /><br /><h3>Depression</h3>If you've ever experienced depression, you probably remember it as a time when nothing gave you much pleasure. That's one of the things that makes depression so painful. People who are depressed often find they have little energy, decreased appetite for food, sleep problems and little interest in sex. Ironically, some antidepressants work fine at alleviating these problems, but have what those television ads euphemistically call ""sexual side effects."" Translated into English, that means difficulty in getting an erection or taking longer than usual to cum. If you've started an antidepressant and those problems sound familiar, talk to your doc. Another medication may treat the depression without making your sex life something else to be depressed about.<br /><br /><h3>Relationship problems</h3>If your relationship is in trouble because the two of you are fighting all the time or going through a period when you really don't want to be together, it's crazy to expect to be attracted to your partner. You may not even want to be around one another.<br /><br />Sex can be a problem when your relationship has hit the skids. It's hard to be all that attracted to a partner at the same time you're experiencing pain or anger with them. You're going to need to deal with those issues before sex has much appeal. What if you feel pretty good about the amount of sex you're having - but all of your friends seem to be having lots more? Remember that sex is your choice, an individual thing. And remember that some of the guys who made up stories about their erotic conquests back in high school are still lying years later.<br /><br />John R.

He can be reached via the web at www.bodymindsoul.org",Sex ProblemsOrgasms,"<p>At the peak of orgasm, a spinal reflex causes smooth muscles around the urethra, penis and prostate into rhythmic contraction in throb after throb, pulse after pulse. Semen spurts out the penis. Ejaculation generally lasts a few seconds. ""Orgasm"" and ""ejaculation"" aren't necessarily the same thing. Because they tend to happen simultaneously in men, we often think they are the same thing. Understanding that they are not the same thing is the key to exploring ecstatic states. </p><p>Orgasm is described by sexologists as the all-of-a-sudden release of the sexual pressure that happens during arousal, followed by an intense relaxation. Missing from this medical explanation is any understanding of what happens elsewhere in our multidimensional beings -- that is, in our hearts, our souls, our minds. Orgasm doesn't happen just in the pelvis. Studies show changes in brain waves, for instance. Muscles tense and relax, emotions arise. Some orgasms are more powerful than others. Sometimes we are seeking a simple release - we are feeling sexual tension, and we want to get rid of it. The resulting orgasm may be a bit of a thrill, and it is certainly pleasurable, but it is a pelvic sneeze compared with full-tilt, openhearted orgasm. The French phrase for orgasm means ""the little death."" </p><p>When we are in an orgasmic state, time seems to stop. We experience something transcendent and powerful. We may feel a sense of clarity, losing our sense of self-consciousness, living only in this moment. In this ecstatic state, we let go of the ego. Our day-to-day anxieties no longer seem so important and we let go of our obsession with the self. We let go of our sense that we are separate from those around us; that's one reason why this ecstatic state is especially powerful for those who are in love. In this orgasmic state we are simply present, alone or with a lover, fully alive and connected with everything that is. It is a powerful spiritual experience, a miracle in itself. Small wonder that so many religions seem to fear sexuality and do everything they can to control it!</p><h3>Basic considerations</h3><p>To be able to let go during sex and to savor this sense of transcendence is one of life's great joys. Let's talk about how to increase your body's capacity for pleasure and how to open yourself more fully to this experience.</p><p>Some basic considerations: Bodies which are full of life are more capable of ecstasy than those which are half asleep. Exercise of at least a mild sort helps. Sex isn't a marathon, but if you spend your life stuck behind a desk and are something of a couch potato at home and have trouble climbing a flight of stairs without getting winded, you're not likely to feel fully awake and at home in your body.</p><p>Next, let go of any goal when having sex other than to feel your body, feel pleasure and connect deeply with your partner (if you are having partner sex rather than solo sex). Notice if you find yourself getting distracted by concerns about erections, what your partner is thinking, how you are doing, etc. Let these thoughts go; be in the moment. If you find yourself distracted by thoughts or worries, work on them later.</p><p>Focus on pleasure rather than orgasm as a goal in itself. Let go of any goal whatsoever. Are you tightening your muscles and holding your body tensely? Let go. Relax. Breathe. Savor sensations and delights for their own sake. There is no hurry. What else could be more important than what you are doing right now?</p><p>When you start to cum, see if you can stay relaxed and breathing. Doing so allows the sensations and rhythms of your body to increase and reverberate inside of you, and it greatly prolongs the pleasure. Keep breathing! Some of us tend to hold our breaths or to breathe very shallowly as we approach our climax. Doing so shuts down sensation. In fact, half the pleasure of some men's orgasms comes from simply relaxing their too-tense bodies.</p><h3>Simultaneous orgasm</h3><p>Our culture enshrines the idea of simultaneous orgasm. That can be fun if it happens spontaneously, but working to that end can turn sex into, well, work. Consider instead what can happen when you cum at different times. You can be your partner's witness -- seeing him in this moment of transcendence, truly being there for him/her. He/she can be there for you, free from his/her own need to do anything other than just be with you; that's magic enough.</p><h3>Afterglow</h3><p>The time following orgasm is sacred time, sometimes referred to as ""afterglow."" Enjoy it, whether you are by yourself or with someone else. Notice what thoughts, even visions, come to you. Notice what you are feeling. Don't be in a big hurry to clean up. Stay where you are. If you have been making love to yourself, this can be a useful time to simply enjoy the feelings of peace and openness. If you are with a partner, this gentle, open time can be a wonderful opportunity to affirm your love for one another. Make the most of it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>A final thought</h3><p>A final thought: the openness that many of us feel after orgasm may bring up negative feelings. Perhaps you realize that the person you just shared this experience with was someone with whom this level of intimacy was more awkward than you expected, or perhaps old messages about sex-and-shame made an unwelcome visit. Don't be too quick to try and get rid of these feelings. There may be an opportunity for you to learn something about yourself. </p><p><br />John R.

And what about good boys and bad boys?<br /><br />Good boys are solid citizens: trustworthy, hard working, clean-cut. When you were young, they were the ones that your mother wanted you to act like. They washed their hands before dinner, always made their beds and got good grades in school. As adults, these attributes might translate into a being a guy with steady career, a bank account that's never overdrawn, and few bad habits.<br /><br />Bad boys are often risk-takers and troublemakers. They enjoy stirring things up just to see what will happen: cutting class if it was too boring, skipping homework if there was something more fun to do, trying forbidden stuff like cigarettes or booze or sex. As adults they may still have that wild streak. Delaying gratification has never been their thing. If there's fun to be had, they are having it.<br /><br />Bi or straight, many of us were raised to choose as mates the virtuous equivalent of the best little boy or girl in the world. At the same time, we secretly enjoyed the company of the fun seekers we knew we better not bring them around the house. Our parents classified our peers as good or bad and we learned to do the same. When it comes to who sexually attracts us, psychotherapists sometimes talk about this (among straight men) as the ""Madonna/whore complex."" Potential partners are seen as either saints or sluts. Saints aren't allowed to be sexy, either.<br /><br />In relationships, this can lead us to seek out the good boys or girls for partnersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦then to lose erotic interest in them. Or we withhold the sexy bad boy parts of ourselves because we worry what our partner (s) would think of us.<br /><br />People spend a fair amount of time trying to get in touch with their ""inner child;"" while they are at it, they might try to get in touch with their inner juvenile delinquent. One way to keep a relationship juicy is for each partner to let his bad boy out from time to time. A life of too much moderation and virtue can become hopelessly boring. (Too much ""bad boy time"" can lead to a life of turmoil, of course.) Relationships that become boring are rarely sexy.<br /><br />What sorts of things let your bad boy out to play? Desires are different for each of us, of course, but there here are some clues: Bad boys are likely to be messier than good boys. They are likely to be less polite; in fact, they might be downright rude or pushy or arrogant. Bad boys sometimes like to show off or make a lot of noise.<br /><br />There's a certain amount of risk involved in letting your bad boy out to play. When we express our desires, we open ourselves up and allow our partner to see another side of us. That can feel vulnerable. When we make ourselves vulnerable and we're treated with respect, good stuff happens. But if expressing our desire makes your partner feel anxious, he may respond in a way that leaves you feeling hurt. So check with your partner to make sure they are willing to go along for the ride. You're much more likely to have fun if your inner rascal isn't going to catch a lot of attitude because your partner's stuffy good boy is in charge.<br /><br />John R.

Most publications in our community feature hunky, barely-clothed models to get our attention and contain ads for phone sex lines, models and escorts, etc. Cruising is the sport of choice among many men in our community. The term ""sex addiction"" has been popularized over the past few years to describe compulsive sexual behavior. The term is controversial in some quarters. When addiction was first coined as a term to describe self-destructive behavior it was used in the context of drug or alcohol abuse. <p>Anything short of complete abstinence from drug or alcohol use was described as relapse. This sort of language becomes a problem when we talk about ""food addiction"" or ""sex addiction,"" where abstaining completely isn't possible. </p><p>I don't think it makes sense to talk about food or sex as ""addictive"" in the same sense that amphetamines or alcohol can be addictive. If a client came to me and said that heroin was ruining his life, I wouldn't try to help him find a way to use the drug in a way that worked for him. Unlike heroin, however, sex is a part of a healthy life for most people. It should also be noted that some programs for ""sex addicts"" identify any sexual behavior outside of heterosexual marriage as sick behavior. There is a political component in identifying all  bi sexual behavior as unhealthy. </p><p>Like so-called ""ex-gay"" ministries and ""reparative therapy,"" these programs are dangerous for gay and bi men. Similarly, it is normal for bi men in the process of coming out to spend a lot of time and energy thinking about sex and sexuality. And some programs for sex addicts either imply or state outright that kinky sex, masturbation or using pornography or erotica makes sex addictive. This is puritanical nonsense. None of this is to minimize the havoc that sex can play in our lives when it becomes compulsive. Sex becomes compulsive when it takes over so much of our lives that other parts of life and well-being suffer, and when they way that we express our sexual desires in ways that are destructive and out of control. The naive assumption some people make is that the person with a sexual compulsion is a hedonistic pleasure seeker or ""oversexed."" Compulsive sexual behavior is unfulfilling rather than passionate. </p><p>The reality is more that the compulsive person probably feels little joy around sex at all. The motivation for sex may be to lessen anxiety, rather than because of feeling sexual desire or horniness. Unfortunately, you can never get enough of what you don't really want. In addition, people who experience sexual compulsion often find that their intimate lives suffer. Real life with an actual person pales in comparison to the thrill hunting down the next sexual adventure. </p><p>If you think your sexual behavior may be compulsive, seek out a sex-positive therapist or other professional familiar with compulsive behavior. A healthy approach to sexuality for bi men emphasizes making sex better as much as making it not harmful. Change and growth are possible, but require more than eliminating old sexual patterns. New behaviors which are more fulfilling need to be brought into the picture if changes are to be long-lasting. Our society is ambivalent about sex -- especially the sexuality of bi men. Establishing a healthy, fulfilling sexuality is a challenge, but well worth it. </p><p><em>John R. Ballew, M.S., is a licensed professional counselor in private practice in Atlanta.

But, like rubber bands, condoms deteriorate with age.If properly stored, they should stay good until the expiration date printed on the wrapper of each condom. </p><p>Condoms may be transparent or opaque, tinted, nipple-ended, rippled, studded, contoured, dry, powdered, or lubricated - with spermicide or without. Read labels on ""novelty"" condoms to be sure they protect against sexually transmitted infections.  Usually, size is not marked on the package. But condoms come in different lengths, widths, and thickness. </p><p>Try different brands and styles to find out which fits best. Condoms are usually available in packages of three or a dozen. Plain, nonlubricated condoms can cost as little as 20 to 30 cents each. </p><p>Other styles and brands can cost from 60 cents to $2.50 each. For lubricated condoms, the average price per dozen is about $6. </p><p>Animal tissue and plastic condoms cost about $25 per dozen.  You can get condoms in drugstores and drug departments of other stores.  </p><p>They also are available in area bars, Public Health departments, STI  Clinics, Planned Parenthood health centers and other family planning  clinics where they may be less expensive or free. Female condoms cost  about $2.50 each. They are available at women's health centers and  drugstores.  <br /><br /> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",CondomNot using condoms,"<p>Several studies across the globe in the last few years indicate an increase in willingness by men surveyed to engage in unsafe sex because of the advent of protease inhibitors. Does this mean ""barebacking"" (Barebacking sex, also called raw or skin-to-skin, essentially refers to intentionally seeking out anal sex without a condom.) is becoming epidemic? Not necessarily. Most studies do not examine whether the cases of unsafe sex were ""slip ups"" or within the context of a relationship. Most activists will agree that there's a difference between unprotected sex and unsafe sex. Couples who share the same HIV status and are in committed relationships may choose to engage in unprotected intercourse. Within AIDS prevention circles, this is generally referred to as ""negotiated safety"" and not bareback sex. Couples whose relationships follow ""negotiated safety"" rules may have sex with other persons, but maintain safer sex guidelines (using condoms) with outside partners.</p><p>This is not a set of HIV prevention guidelines. The information is intended only for gay and bisexual men who have already decided not to use condoms for anal sex, some advocates believe these strategies may help reduce the risk associated with barebacking. Here, risk should be interpreted more broadly than HIV infection; these tips may also help reduce the risk of other STD's as well as HIV. And bear in mind that much of this info is anecdotal and under debate by researchers.</p><h3>Poppers and Viagra</h3><p>Both of these increase your risk. Dilated blood vessels in the rectum caused by sniffing poppers make it easier for viruses to enter your bloodstream, so if your partner ejaculates inside you, you're wide open for infection. Viagra works similarly and poses similar risks by increasing blood flow to the pelvic region, facilitating erection, and to the rectum. Actually, did you know that this combination has led to death in some instances? ""You want him stiff, but not that stiff.""</p><h3>Lubricant</h3><p>Use it generously to help prevent tears that allow infection. Don't rely on saliva. Some lubrication comes with Nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) in it. Avoid lubricants with Nonoxynol-9. It has been shown to damage the delicate lining of the anus and has been associated with INCREASED risk of HIV transmission.</p><h3>Early withdrawal</h3><p>Early withdrawal before ejaculation may reduce risk. But since HIV and other infectious agents are in pre-cum, this method still poses a risk.</p><h3>Limiting</h3><p>Rationing barebacking over time limits the number of exposures and sex partners - which can reduce the risk of harm-and allows time for healing of tears or trauma in the rectum, urethra and outer skin of the penis.</p><h3>Negotiation</h3><p>Try to talk with partners about STD status, including HIV, herpes, hepatitis and human papilloma virus (which causes anal and genital warts). If talk isn't part of your sex, you may be able to see or feel warts, lesions, discharge or other physical signs of STDs. Be aware that one may be asymptomatic yet still infectious. Decide ahead of time if you're willing to cum in your partner or allow him to cum in you, then assess your ability to trust your mutual adherence to that agreement.</p><h3>Before- and after-care</h3><p>Douching or using enemas with harsh detergents can strip away protective cells in the rectum. If you use an enema before sex, try warm water. Be careful not to create tears inside or around the anus. Some believe lubes, especially oil- and silicon-based, can trap germs against the skin, increasing likelihood of infection. Douching with a spermicidal foam or homemade vinegar-and-water solution after sex may render some infectious agents inactive, but little research has been conducted in this area. If you are having sex with multiple partners over a short time, don't douche until after the last one. Try to urinate right after sex: Urine's acidity can help clean out the urethra.</p><h3>Immunity</h3><p>The more stressed, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, tired or ill you are, chances will be higher that an exposure results in infection. If you have HIV and another STD, you are more likely to transmit HIV. If you're HIV negative and have an STD, you're more likely to become infected with HIV if exposed.<br /><br />Get vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B. Barebacking exposes you to fecal matter and other Hepatitis-transmitting fluids. </p>",CondomTalking about condom use,"<p> It can help create a relaxed mood to make sex more enjoyable. It may be difficult to talk about using condoms. In any case, don't let embarrassment become a health risk. The following script may give you some ideas.<br /><br />Sample script for safer sex (Some are Cheesy!)</p><p>If Your Partner Says:  What's that?<br />You Can Say:  A condom, sweetheart.<br /><br />If Your Partner Says:  What for?<br />You Can Say:  To use when we're making love.<br /><br />If Your Partner Says:  I don't like using them.<br />You Can Say:  Why not?<br /><br />If Your Partner Says:  It doesn't feel as good.<br />You Can Say:  I'll feel more relaxed, and if I'm more relaxed, I can make it feel better for you.<br /><br />If Your Partner Says:  But we've never used a condom before.<br />You Can Say:  I don't want to take any more risks.<br /><br />If Your Partner Says:  Don't you trust me?<br />You Can Say:  Trust isn't the point.

You know how to play checkers?<br /><br />If you are a virgin and have decided to have sex and want to use a condom and your partner says:  Just this once without it. Just the first time.</p><p>You Can Say:  It can only take once to get a sexually transmitted infection. It only takes once to get AIDS.</p><p>If your partner absolutely refuses to wear a latex condom, you can use a female condom. Some men have said that the sensation is not so reduced with a female condom. Don't be afraid of being rejected. Besides, the partner who doesn't care about protecting your health and well-being is not worth your sexual involvement.</p>",CondomCondom Considerations,"<table border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"" class=""statTbl"" align=""center""><tbody><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#c0c0c0"">Safe with All Condoms</font></strong></td><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#c0c0c0"">Unsafe with Latex Condoms</font></strong></td></tr><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><font color=""#c0c0c0"">Aloe-9Â® <br />AquaLubeÂ® <br />AstroGlideÂ® <br />deLubeÂ® <br />ForPlayÂ® <br />glycerin<br />Gynol IIÂ® <br />H-R Â® lubricating jelly<br />K-YÂ® Jelly<br />PrePairÂ® <br />RamsesÂ® Personal Spermicide<br />silicone lubricant<br />spermicide<br />TouchÂ® Personal Lubricant <br />water and saliva<br />WetÂ® </font></td><td class=""copy""><font color=""#c0c0c0"">baby oil<br />cold creams <br />CornhuskersÂ® lubricant<br />edible oils (olive, peanut, corn, sunflower) <br />head and body lotions<br />massage oils<br />mineral oil <br />petroleum jelly <br />shortening <br />suntan oil and lotions<br />Bag BalmÂ® <br />whipped cream <br />certain vaginal yeast <br />infection medications</font></td></tr></tbody></table>",CondomPutting on a Condom,"<h3>Remember practice makes perfect</h3>Men leak fluids from their penises before and after ejaculation. Pre-ejaculate (""pre-cum"") can carry enough sperm to cause STIs. Use a condom only once. Use a fresh one for each erection (""hard-on""). Have a good supply on hand. Condoms usually come rolled into a ring shape. They are individually sealed in aluminum foil or plastic. Be careful - don't tear the condom while unwrapping it. If it is brittle, stiff, or sticky, throw it away and use another.<br />1) Put a drop or two of lubricant inside the condom.<br /><br />2) If not circumcised, pull back the foreskin before rolling on the condom.<br /><br />3) Place the rolled condom over the tip of the hard penis.<br /><br />4) Leave a half-inch space at the tip to collect semen.<br /><br />5) Pinch the air out of the tip with one hand. (Friction against air bubbles causes most condom breaks.)<br /><br />6) Unroll the condom over the penis with the other hand.<br /><br />7) Roll it all the way down to the base of the penis.<br /><br />8) Smooth out any air bubbles.<br /><br />9) Lubricate the outside of the condom. <br />",CondomFemale condom,"The idea is simple enough: The small end is inserted into the anus with the large ring staying on the outside. In this way, the insertive partner can slide in and out without exchanging any body fluids. According to the Reality Web site, it has over a 97 percent success rate in preventing the spread of HIV and other STDs during vaginal sex. There are no statistics listed with regard to anal intercourse. <p>A spokesman for the company said the FDA has only approved the condom for vaginal use, and they cannot endorse or market the condom for anal sex, gay or straight. The FDA does not approve any condoms for anal sex. The Reality condom is made of polyurethane as opposed to the latex of most male condoms. Although this makes the Reality condom more expensive, ($2-$5 each), it has some advantages.</p><p> First, polyurethane conducts body heat, so it gives a more natural feel. Second, it can be used with oil-based lubricants. And third, it is stronger than latex so is it more difficult to break. Most of the problems reported with the female condom have to do with the man pulling out completely and then re-entering accidentally on the outer edge of the condom. </p><p>There is a lack of data on how effective these things are for gay men to use. Men are instructed to insert the condom into the anus with the fingers poking the small ring into place. Then the partner can insert his penis. Some men said that this didn't work well for them. In fact, they gave some very different advice:  ""Be sure to take the small ring out. It just hurts the bottom a lot and is not all that easy to insert, especially if the bottom is not relaxed."" </p><p>Another suggested taking the ring out also, but added, ""I put it on like a regular condom and push it in. You just have to use lots of lube on the inside and outside of the condom. Once it's in, it's like wearing nothing at all.""  All the men I spoke with who had used the female condom gave it a 4-star rating. They all reported increased performance and had an easier time staying hard and reaching orgasm. </p><p>Their partners seemed to like it more, too. ""Regular condoms...burn after a while. The female condoms don't hurt at all. In fact, I can take it longer and harder than usual.""  Most men report that after figuring out how to use the female condom they were much more likely to use the female condom over the traditional male version, which might mean less barebacking and more safer sex.  So give Reality a try. The most you have to lose is $2, and it could save your health. </p><h3>So why use them?</h3><p>Many gay men have problems with the conventional condom - these problems often stop them from having penetrative sex or encourage them to have penetrative sex without the protection of a condom. The problems men encounter include difficulties in getting condoms on because they find they are too tight, or because they cannot get the condom over the head of their penis, or because they go soft. Some men find condoms just don't stay on (they roll off due to the shape of their penis), or that they are to loose. </p><p>Some say that condoms interrupt the spontaneity of sex (female condoms can be put in before sex), others say they reduce the sensitivity or they have lost faith in them because of past breakages during sex. As mentioned before, the Female condom is made from polyurethane so oil based lubricants will not harm it. </p><p>For anyone who likes to massage before sex, a Female condom is likely to be a safer alternative, since coming into contact with massage oils will not harm it. It is advised that people continue to use water-based lubricant as this will encourage the use of the correct lubricant for conventional condom use.  An increasing number of gay and bisexual men are finding that Female condoms are a practical alternative to conventional latex condoms. </p>",CondomUsing a condom,"<h3>What kind of condoms are best for men who have sex with men?</h3>There are no condoms specifically made for man-to-man sex, but some are better choices than others. Latex condoms are the best choice. They are made from a synthetic rubber material that HIV can't penetrate. According to the June, 1999 issue of Consumer Reports, which tested 30 brands of condoms, only two failed the standard test that measures condom strength: Trojan Plus 2 Spermicidal and Durex Pure Protection Spermicidally Lubricated. The magazine also reported that ""extra sensitive"" condoms are indeed thinner but not weaker than the standard condom. (To order the June, 1999 issue of Consumer Reports, call 1-800-234-1645, or visit www.consumerreports.org Request article #9411). The lambskin condom, usually made from lamb intestine, is not the best choice. The lambskin condom's membrane is porous so that it is possible for HIV to pass right through it! Lambskin condoms are less effective, but they are better than nothing and probably prevent most STD/HIV transmission.<br /><br />Straight couples may use it as an effective birth control method, but gay men should leave lambskin on the store shelf (or better yet, in the lamb who can make best use of it).<br /><h3>How should a condom feel when I put it on?</h3>Good, the condom should feel good. Be sure it fits tightly enough so it will stay on your penis even during a lively sexual encounter. You don't want it to squeeze too tightly either. If regular condoms feel too constrictive, try a larger size.<br /><h3>Can I keep a condom from breaking?</h3>There's always a chance that a perfectly fine condom will break during sex. More often, though, a condom that breaks is one that has been treated roughly or has seen better days. To help steer clear of trouble: Never use a worn-looking, brittle, stiff condom, or one that has expired or was not properly stored (see the box for storage instructions). Don't carry condoms in your wallet or pants pocket, because your body heat can weaken them. And, avoid making tiny holes in the latex by using scissors or your teeth to open a condom wrapper; those holes could cause the condom to tear during sex, or HIV could leak through them.<br /><br />Unlike a vagina, an anus does not make it's own lubrication -- you must supply it yourself. Use only the water-based kind (an oil-based lube will damage the condom!). Even if you buy a condom that comes with lubrication, you'll want to add more. Some lubrication comes with Nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) in it. Avoid lubricants with Nonoxynol-9. It has been shown to damage the delicate lining of the anus and has been associated with INCREASED risk of HIV transmission.<br /><h3>Can I have an allergy to condoms or lube?</h3>Yes, you can. Signs of an allergy are redness and irritation on your penis or rectum. If you notice these signs, try other brands. If you have an allergy to latex, you can try the Avanti brand, which makes condoms from polyurethane. Spermicide has also been known to cause irritation. If you suspect it's causing a problem, switch to a non-spermicidal brand.<br /><h3>How effectively do spermicidal condoms kill HIV?</h3>Nonoxynol-9 (the most commonly available spermicide) has been shown to kill HIV in a test tube. But in real life situations, Nonoxynol-9 has been associated with an INCREASE in HIV transmissions. Nonoxynol-9 provides no protection against STDs or HIV and should not be used for disease prevention.<br /><h3>What about piercings?</h3>A condom placed over a pierced penis has an increased chance of breaking. To be on the safe side, stick with the thick brands and avoid the thinner, ""extra sensitive"" ones. Also, you may find that a large size condom fits you and or your partners' piercing more comfortably.",CondomToys and fisting,"A man who insisted he was straight and loved to get fisted asked me to check him out to be sure he was not doing any harm to himself. His muscle was loose, and I explained the dangers of fisting to him. Before he left, my curiosity got to me, so I asked him whom he got to fist him. He told me that there was a lady who lived down the hall who loved to do it. She suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome and the fisting made it feel better!<br /><p><br />Fisting is dangerous! In order to accommodate your partner's hand or arm, your sphincter muscle must stretch to the max. Fisting can pass STDs and damage your colon and sphincter muscles. Wear latex gloves, use a water-based lubricant and be careful!</p><h3>Anus</h3><p>Inserting toys or fists into your anus can be a very pleasurable experience. Lubricate them with a water- soluble lubricant, cover toys with condoms and wear latex gloves for fisting. Oils can damage gloves and condoms that you may use to have safer anal sex, and can block anal glands and irritate your skin, so always use only water-soluble lube. The toy or fist should be inserted with constant, gentle pressure. Initially guide it posterior (towards the tail bone) and then angle it forward. Stop immediately if you feel pain or bleed. If your partner inserts a toy or fist, guide him or her; they depend on you for clues that all is going well. Stay away from toys with with sharp, rough or jagged edges and, for goodness sakes, take off your rings before fisting someone! If you have trouble getting a toy in, start with a smaller size and work up to the size you want. Stimulating your penis will also increase your sphincter contraction and make passing the toy or fist more difficult. Some men use recreational drugs to help relax their sphincter muscles, but if you're considering this, remember that it can increase your risk of HIV if it leads to unsafe anal sex.</p><h3>Penis</h3><p>Some men like the sensation of a probe or other object inserted into the penis - Do not do this! Sure, doctors do it, but they go to school for many years to learn the proper technique and it's just not safe to do yourself. The lining of your urethra is extremely delicate and foreign objects can easily tear it. The injury can lead to scarring in later years that makes it difficult or impossible to urinate.</p><h2>Complications</h2><h3>Bleeding</h3><p>Most often from hemorrhoids or a tear. Stop and take stool softeners and soak in a warm bath. It will usually heal on its own. No more toys or fists until the bleeding stops.</p><h3>STDs</h3><p>Infections can pass between partners from fists or shared toys. Keep your toys to yourself. If you share, cover them with condoms, and always wear a latex glove for fisting</p><h3>Pain</h3><p>Usually a fissure (tear) or muscle spasm. Stop and take stool softeners and soak in a warm bath. It will usually heal on its own. No more toys or fists until the pain stops.</p><h3>Lost toys</h3><p>To prevent losing your toy inside your anus, choose a toy with a wide end that will keep it from getting lost in there. If it does get lost, your sphincter muscles will close. Squat down and try to move your bowels. Most of the time this will work and the toy will pass on its own. If it doesn't come out, get to an emergency room. An object left in can perforate your colon. Don't try to reach in and grab it, or flush it out with enemas. This will only push it up higher.</p><h3>Perforation</h3><p>Toys and fists are not as pliable as a penis and can be much longer. They can reach the bend in your colon (approximately 8 inches up) and may not negotiate it. If they don't make the turn, they can break through your colon wall. This is a life and death emergency. Go straight to a hospital and tell them what happened. This is no time to delay treatment because of embarrassment.</p><h3>Incontinence</h3><p>Thick toys and fists can damage your anal sphincter muscles. These muscles heal with scarring, leaving them less elastic so that they do not contract as well as they did before injury. This can lead to an inability to control bowel movements or gas in later years.</p>",Sex InfoLipodystrophy,,ComplicationsMycobacterium Avium,"While there's basically no way to avoid contact with the organisms, drugs are available to prevent the development of MAC in people at risk. Until recently, doctors were more pessimistic about treating MAC disease in people with HIV, but with the innovation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prognosis for HIV-infected individuals with MAC has improved tremendously.  <h3>What is it?</h3> MAC is caused by an extremely common type of mycobacteria, found in food, water and dust. It usually infects a person through his or her lungs or intestines. The bacteria that cause MAC live in our bodies without causing disease -- most people with healthy immune systems never even know they have it. The infection can be dangerous to people with HIV and other disorders that weaken immunity. In advanced HIV disease, MAC can become disseminated and cause fevers, weight loss and anemia. MAC can be resistant to medication, and up until recently, it was one of the most common life-threatening opportunistic infections associated with AIDS.  MAC and tuberculosis are both caused by mycobacteria. The symptoms of disseminated MAC can be similar to those found in patients with active tuberculosis, and vice-versa. Culture of the organism in blood or sputum can usually identify which mycobacteria you are dealing with. MAC in the sputum is rarely the cause of symptoms.  <h3>Symptoms</h3> People with disseminated MAC can have any combination of anemia, blood disorders, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, abdominal pain, fatigue, skin infections, painful joints, swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged liver and spleen, and diarrhea.  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> Laboratory tests can detect the organism in your blood, bone marrow, or tissue. Other tests are necessary in certain cases. <h3>How is it acquired?</h3>  MAC is everywhere. It's carried by many animals: birds, chickens, pigs, cows, rabbits and dogs. They're in your food and drinking water as well as dirt and in dust (when is the last time you cleaned your house?). MAC doesn't spread from one person to another.  <h3>How to treat it?</h3><p> Mild cases of MAC infection in people with healthy immune systems can clear up naturally. If you have HIV and your T-cell count drops below 50, you are at risk and should be on medication -- such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, sometimes rifabutin -- to prevent MAC from infecting you. Children with HIV need to be medicated well before their T-cell counts approach 50; the exact number varies with age. </p><p>Rifabutin can cause serious side effects and can interact with some anti-TB medication; both rifabutin and clarithromycin can interact with anti-HIV medications. Anti-MAC drugs, in combination with HAART, treat the disease much more effectively than anti-MAC medications alone. Maintenance therapy is still suggested for people who have had the infection to prevent its recurrence. Consult with your doctor about which medications are right for you.  <br />  </p><h3>Prevention</h3><p> Avoiding MAC is pretty tough, since it's everywhere. If you want to try, some medical professionals suggest boiling drinking water, avoiding raw and unpasteurized foods, rinsing and peeling vegetables, avoiding contact with animals (especially birds), and giving up alcohol. However, it's not clear how effective these precautions are. People with advanced HIV disease should be offered medication to help prevent the development of symptoms. MAC usually appears only in adults with T-cell counts below 50, although the number is higher in children with HIV and they should begin medication earlier.  Treatment for MAC involves a combination of two or more antibiotics. </p><p>In cases where a person's T-cells rise, their own immune system might take over and allow them to stop taking medication for MAC. Otherwise, MAC treatment usually needs to continue indefinitely. MAC can occasionally infect people with healthy immune systems, especially middle-aged adults whose lungs have been damaged by diseases, such as emphysema, TB, or by smoking. In children, MAC most often causes an infection of the lymph nodes. MAC is much more common in people with advanced HIV -- 20 to 30 percent of people with AIDS will develop MAC. People with HIV are at increased risk for developing MAC and it is one of the leading opportunistic infections that accompanies the disease. </p><p>Usually, this won't happen unless your T-cell count drops below 50 and as a result, it's not usually the first opportunistic infection to surface. Twenty to thirty percent of people with AIDS get MAC. Children with HIV are likely to get MAC at higher T-cell levels. Although the prognosis used to be grim for HIV-infected people with disseminated MAC, the combination of anti-MAC medications and HAART have helped a great deal. Keep in mind that some anti-MAC drugs can have unwanted interactions with anti-HIV and anti-TB drugs, so check with your doctor. <br />  </p><h3>Incubation period</h3> The germs are everywhere, including your body. But they usually become dangerous only after your immunity drops to very low levels. <h3>Sex</h3> The disease is not spread from person to person, so there is no real risk of contracting it through sex.",ComplicationsOpportunistic Infections ,"  <h3>What is it?</h3> Common opportunistic infections include: candidiasis, a yeast infection of the mouth, throat or vagina; cytomegalovirus (CMV), a viral infection that can cause blindness or intestinal problems; mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), a bacterial infection that causes fever, digestive problems and significant weight loss; pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a deadly pneumonia caused by a protozoal infection; toxoplasmosis (toxo), a protozoal infection of the brain that causes headache, nausea, confusion, poor coordination and seizures; tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection that harms your lungs; and kaposi's sarcoma, known for its flat or raised purple skin lesions.  <h3>Symptoms</h3> The symptoms are different for each opportunistic infection. For more details, please do a specific search of our database.  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> You doctor can test your blood for many opportunistic infections.<h3>How is it acquired?</h3> Most of the germs that cause opportunistic infections are very common and difficult to avoid: some are airborne, some are spread on contact, and most are dormant in your body already.  <h3>How to treat it?</h3> Luckily, available medications treat many opportunistic infections. Even better, if your immune system gains back its strength, it can fight these infections on its own (kaposi's sarcoma, for example, can disappear as your T cells rise). If you have HIV, talk to your doctor about treatments to fight it and ways to improve your immunity.  <br /> <h3>Myths dispelled</h3> Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions.  <ul> <li>Even if you decide not to take antiviral medication, you still need drugs to fight your opportunistic infections.</li>  </ul><h3>Prevention </h3><p>Because most of the organisms that cause opportunistic infections are very common, prevention without medication is difficult.  Many opportunistic infections strike when your T cells fall below certain thresholds. Doctors often start drug therapies early on to prevent certain infections from developing. For further protection, keep yourself and your surroundings clean.  </p><table border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"" class=""statTbl"" align=""center""> <tbody><tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy""><strong>CD4 Cell Count</strong></td> <td class=""copy""><strong>Prophylaxis Measure</strong></td> <td class=""copy""><strong>Goal</strong></td> </tr> <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">Any</td> <td class=""copy"">Pneumovax every 5 to 10 years</td> <td class=""copy"">Prevent pneumococcal pneumonia</td>  </tr>  <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">Any</td> <td class=""copy"">Hepatitis B vaccine series</td> <td class=""copy"">Prevent hepatitis B</td>  </tr>  <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">Any</td> <td class=""copy"">Flu vaccine, yearly</td> <td class=""copy"">Prevent influenza*</td>  </tr>  <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">Any</td> <td class=""copy"">PPD, yearly</td> <td class=""copy"">Tests for exposure to tuberculosis</td>  </tr>  <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">&lt; 200</td> <td class=""copy"">Bactrim daily** or TIW</td> <td class=""copy"">Prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)</td>  </tr>  <tr align=""center""> <td class=""copy"">&gt; 50</td> <td class=""copy"">Zithromycin weekly or Biaxin daily</td> <td class=""copy"">Prevent MAC</td>  </tr>  </tbody></table><p>  * distinct from H flu or Haemophilus vaccine which not routinely recommended.<br />** or dapsone or pentamidine depending on drug tolerance. </p><p>For those taking bactrim daily, evidence shows they will be well protected against toxoplasmosis.  Anyone with a weakened immune system, including people with HIV or those undergoing treatments for diseases such as cancer, can develop an opportunistic infection. These infections can be deadly, so see your doctor regularly. </p><h3>Incubation period</h3> For more details about a specific opportunistic infection, please do a search of our database. <h3>Sex</h3> Certain opportunistic infections, like herpes, can result from bodily contact. Others, like PCP and TB, are airborne. If your immune system is weakened, you must be extra cautious before becoming intimate with someone whose health history is unknown to you. And certainly avoid kissing someone who has symptoms of infection. <h3>Prevalence</h3> The organisms that cause opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems are very common. Some can even be spread through the air or by contact.  <h3>Complications</h3> Certain opportunistic infections can be fatal in people with weakened immune systems. If you have HIV or are on medications to treat diseases such as cancer, let your doctor know so he or she can evaluate your health.",ComplicationsPneumocystis Carinii,"  <h3>What is it?</h3> Pneumocystis Carinii is the name of the protozoa that causes Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia (PCP), a serious infection commonly found in the lungs. Though most people have been exposed to the organism itself, only those with weakened immune systems, including people with HIV, are in danger of infection. PCP is the most common serious infection among people with HIV in the United States, and can lead to death if not quickly treated.  <h3>Symptoms</h3> The symptoms of PCP include cough, fever, weakness, weight loss and difficulty breathing. People who were once infected with PCP are more likely to catch it again. If you think you have PCP, see your doctor right away!  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> Your doctor can diagnose PCP by running lab tests on the tissue or fluid from your lungs. This may require a bronchoscopy -- inserting a tube down your throat so your doctor can inspect the insides of your lungs and collect the samples. <h3>How is it acquired?</h3> Pneumocystis Carinii is very common in our environment, and is believed to be spread through the air, like many other organisms. Unfortunately, a pneumonia vaccination won't help; it protects you from a different type of pneumonia, not PCP!  If you have HIV and develop a cough, fever or difficulty breathing, see your doctor immediately. <h3>How to treat it?</h3> The good news is that, when caught early enough, PCP can be effectively treated. If you have HIV, your doctor will draw your blood to check your CD4 cell count. If it falls below 200, most doctors prescribe trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), commonly known as Bactrim, Cotrim and Septra, to guard against PCP.  Some people are allergic to sulfa-containing antibiotics. Your doctor may try an alternative medication or slowly desensitize you to sulfa. <br /> <h3>Myths dispelled</h3>  Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions.  <ul> <li>Yes, the pneumonia vaccination can protect you, but not from PCP!</li> <li>The vaccine works against a different kind of pneumonia. </li> </ul>  <h3>Prevention</h3>  Pneumocystis is very easy to catch, but the great news is that the same drugs used for treatment can prevent it from becoming a serious infection! If you have HIV, talk to your doctor about starting medications while you're healthy, to protect you even if you do become exposed.  Please note: A pneumonia or flu vaccination will not protect you from PCP!  <h3>Sex</h3> The germ that causes PCP is believed to spread through the air, so kissing an infected person is a good way to catch it. Use common sense and avoid intimacy with someone who is wrestling with a cough or fever.  <br /> <h3>Prevalence</h3> PCP is very common, and is believed to be spread through the air.  <h3>Complications</h3> Though most people do become exposed to the organism that causes PCP, only those with weakened immune systems are in danger infection. PCP is the most common serious infection among people with HIV in the United States, and it can lead to death if not quickly treated.",ComplicationsHIV Wasting Syndrome ," This condition causes you to lose your body fat as well as your lean body mass, leaving you weak and susceptible to further illness.  <em>Last Thanksgiving, one friend, who started wasting after having HIV for many years, brought out an old photo album and showed me pictures taken when he was younger and husky. ""Back then,"" he joked, ""All I heard was, 'Lose weight!' Now I can't keep it on.""</em><p>&nbsp;</p><p> HIV Wasting Syndrome is a progressive and unintended loss of more than 10 percent of your body weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is the second leading cause of HIV and AIDS-related death in the United States, and the third leading cause of death throughout the world. The symptoms of wasting, which include diarrhea, fever, poor appetite and weakness, contribute to your loss of both body fat and lean body mass (muscle), leaving you susceptible to further illness. </p><p>According to a study from the Journal of Clinical Endocrinological Metabolism, women in the early stages of wasting tend to lose more of their body fat, while men tend to lose more of their lean body mass. Low testosterone levels in men have also been found to result in wasting.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3> The symptoms of wasting include weight loss, loss of fat and muscle mass (particularly on the sides of your head), diarrhea, fever, malnutrition, depression, poor appetite and weakness.  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> Your doctor will likely diagnosis you with wasting syndrome if you have HIV and have lost more than ten percent of your body weight. <h3>How is it acquired?</h3> HIV Wasting Syndrome occurs in people with HIV. Loss of appetite, the main culprit,  is often exacerbated by the side effects of antiviral medications,  which include nausea, diarrhea and changes in your taste sensations.  The small intestines of people with HIV are subject to infections  that cause poor absorption of the nutrients, adding to the problem.  Finally, your body needs more energy to fight HIV, but when you can't  bring yourself to eat much, you're depriving your immune system of  energy.<h3>How to treat it?</h3><p> Treatment for HIV Wasting Syndrome targets the cause. To help you eat more, your doctor may prescribe an appetite stimulant and a nausea suppressant. (Marijuana, which seems to help with nausea and appetite, has been the focus of AIDS activists who seek to legalize the drug for medical purposes). </p><p>To help your body absorb nutrients, your doctor may prescribe medicine to fight infections in your small intestine and stop diarrhea. Hormone therapy, steroids and even thalidomide are possible ways of helping you gain back the body mass that you've lost.  Talk to your doctor about starting a weight training program. </p><p>Though there is no evidence that lifting weights will reverse or postpone wasting, exercise may increase your appetite.  Finally, if you suffer from severe malnutrition, your doctor may recommend a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy, or feeding tube) to help increase your body weight and nutrient intake. Hyperalimentation (intravenous nutritional supplementation) is reserved for the most severe forms of wasting. <br /> </p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3> Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions. <ul> <li>Physical symptoms, including loss of appetite and nausea, make it very difficult for a person with wasting syndrome to eat.</li> <li>Depression may compound this problem.</li> <li>The weight loss, however, is involuntary, and should not be confused with anorexia. </li> </ul> <h3>Prevention</h3><p> If you have HIV, are dropping weight and have weakness, fever and diarrhea, see your doctor for a BIA (bioelectrical impedance analysis). It's a common procedure that measures your lean body mass, helping your doctor to determine what treatments, if any, should be given.  Also ask your doctor or dietician about starting a nutritional program before you become symptomatic. A regimen of vitamin and mineral supplements and appetite stimulants may reduce wasting.  A low testosterone level causes wasting in men with HIV. </p><p>Ask your doctor to check your testosterone, and if it's low, begin hormone therapy. Not only can it help protect you from opportunistic infections, but it can also maintain your body weight. <br /> </p>",ComplicationsCandidiasis ,"<h3>What is it?</h3> Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection caused by the common Candida yeast. This condition is known as thrush when it affects your mouth, and vaginitis when it affects the vagina. Normally, your immune system keeps candidiasis at bay, but in people with weakened immune systems, the yeast multiplies too quickly and develops into a harmful infection. Because the offending yeast lives in or on most everyone's bodies, there is no way to avoid it.  You can identify thrush by its trademark red spots or white patches that resemble cottage cheese. Symptoms of vaginitis include burning, itching and a whitish, thick vaginal discharge. Candida yeast can also grow in the folds of your skin, particularly in your groin, buttocks, and under your arms and breasts.  <h3>Symptoms</h3> Thrush is candidiasis in your mouth. Symptoms include red spots or white patches that look like cottage cheese. You may experience sore throat, pain when swallowing, nausea and loss of appetite. When the infection spreads past your throat, it's known as esophagitis.  Vaginitis is candidiasis in the vagina. Symptoms include burning, itching and a thick, whitish discharge.  Candidiasis in your skins folds is red, itchy and it burns. You'll notice a sharp contrast between the redness and your regular skin color.  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> Your doctor can diagnose candidiasis by observing the signs of the disease, culturing the yeast and drawing your blood to measure the strength of your immune system.<h3>How is it acquired?</h3> Candidiasis is caused by the common Candida yeast found in or on your body and in the environment. Your trouble begins when your immune system, weakened by HIV or another disease, can no longer keep the yeast at bay.  <br /><h3>How to treat it?</h3><p> Your doctor can treat candidiasis locally (using creams and liquids applied directly to the infected area) or systematically (with pills or intravenous medications). Typically, doctors prefer to try local treatments first to avoid side effects (including nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain) that can occur with systematic treatments.  Local anti-fungal treatments include skin creams, lozenges and liquids, as well as suppositories and creams that can be inserted into your vagina. Systemic drugs include Nizoral (ketoconazole), Diflucan (fluconazole) or Sporanox (itraconazole).  Because candidiasis can recur, your doctor may keep you on anti-fungal medication. </p><p>The only drawback is that the yeast can become resistant to the drugs, rendering them ineffective for future treatment.  If these medicines don't clear up your infection, your doctor may prescribe amphotericin B, a potent, toxic drug that is given intravenously when other drugs and therapies have failed. Side effects include kidney problems, fever, chills, nausea, anemia, vomiting and headache. The severity of these symptoms usually lessens after the first few doses.  Normally, the good bacteria in your body help keep candidiasis in check. If you're prescribed antibiotics, it's important to remember that they kill the bad bacteria as well as the good. </p><p>The elimination of too many good bacteria can cause an outbreak of candidiasis. Ask your doctor about replenishing your good bacteria with acidophilus, found in yogurt.  Some people with candidiasis prefer to use natural, non-drug therapies to treat their condition, even though there's no scientific proof that they work. Among the favorites: reducing your sugar intake, eating garlic, gargling with a mixture of water and tea tree oil and taking vitamin B.  <br /> </p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3> Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions. <ul> <li>While it's true that candidiasis in your mouth or throat often means you have HIV, there are many other causes.</li> <li>You need to take all of your prescribed medication. </li> <li>Likewise, a vaginal yeast infection doesn't necessarily mean you have HIV. </li> </ul><h3>Prevention</h3> To prevent candidiasis, your doctor can prescribe the same medications used for treatment. Most doctors don't do this, however, because the yeast can develop a resistance to the drugs. Your doctor might also advise against preventative measures because candidiasis is rarely dangerous and easily treated. <br />  <h3>Prevalence</h3> Candidiasis is caused by candida yeast, which is found in or on most everyone's bodies, as well as in our environment. It can become a serious problem if you have a weakened immune system; even if you don't, candidiasis can still infect you, especially if you're diabetic. Women often get vaginal yeast infections after taking a course of antibiotics, which kill the bacteria that normally keep yeast in check. Dangerous complications associated with candidiasis are rare, but they can occur if your immune system is severely weakened or if the yeast is resistant to medication.",ComplicationsAnemia,"Both HIV and powerful drug combinations used to treat HIV can cause anemia. For people with HIV related anemia, activities that were once easy - grocery shopping, going to the gym, walking the dog - may become difficult to do.  <h3>What is it?</h3> Red blood cells contain hemoglobin (Hg), a protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to your body's tissues and cells. If you have anemia, your body doesn't have a sufficient number of red blood cells or enough hemoglobin. As a result, your body's organs don't get the amount of oxygen they need to work properly. Anemia can leave you feeling dizzy and short of breath. <h3>Symptoms</h3> Symptoms of anemia include extreme weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, trouble concentrating, rapid heart beat, chest pains, trouble sleeping, loss of sex drive, pale skin and headache.<h3>How is it acquired?</h3> Certain types of anemia are caused by factors that are temporary and controllable. For example, poor diet, especially one that lacks enough iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid, could cause anemia. Anemia could also occur if your body has trouble absorbing these nutrients. Finally, blood loss, such as from surgery or a bleeding ulcer can also be a cause.  Other types of anemia are chronic, and often related to other diseases. For example:  <ul> <li>HIV and AIDS. Both HIV and AIDS, and some of the medications used to treat the disease, can cause the onset of anemia. </li> <li>Cancer and chemotherapy. Cancer can reduce the number of red blood cells your body makes, and chemotherapy, a treatment for cancer, can prevent your body from making red blood cells (and it also destroys healthy red blood cells).</li>  <li>Inherited diseases of the blood. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes your body to produce faulty hemoglobin. </li> </ul> <h3>How to treat it?</h3> Treatment for anemia varies depending on what type of anemia you have. For example, if you have iron-deficiency anemia, you may need to eat more foods rich in iron, including eggs, green vegetables, fish and poultry or you can take a dietary supplement. Pain medications and antibiotics may be necessary for people with sickle cell anemia. Medicine may be used for people with a chronic disease, HIV or cancer for example. Often it is the treatment for HIV or cancer -- antiviral medications or chemotherapy -- that are causing the anemia. In these cases, medicine may help your condition. <br />",ComplicationsCMV ,"<p>Unfortunately, CMV can pose serious problems to certain groups of people: unborn babies and those with compromised immune systems. For people taking drugs to suppress immunity and people with HIV, CMV can be a dangerous opportunistic infection, frequently taking the form of CMV retinitis, an eye disease that can cause blindness.  </p><h3>What is it?</h3> CMV is a virus that is extremely common and usually harmless. It is spread through the bodily fluids of a person who has been infected with the disease. CMV goes through long periods of dormancy-sometimes a whole lifetime-but can become active at various times in a person's life. Usually, the infected person wouldn't have any idea whether the disease was active or dormant, since it typically has no symptoms. There are no signs to indicate whether a person infected with the virus is actively shedding it in his or her bodily fluids.  While it is not usually much of a threat, the disease can become active in people with compromised immune systems and cause serious problems such as: retinitis (a disease of the eye that can cause blindness), ulcers in the esophagus and lower intestine, diseases of the central nervous system, and pneumonia.  <h3>Symptoms</h3> Usually, none. Sometimes the virus can cause something like mononucleosis with a fever and a mild hepatitis. Don't forget that for most people, the disease is nothing to worry about.  In people with compromised immune systems, the virus can attack many parts of the body and cause many different symptoms. Watch out for vision problems, including hazy vision, blurred or missing areas of vision, and floaters (little moving specks or threads). For people with weakened immunity at special risk of contracting CMV, any changes in vision should be checked out immediately. Symptoms of CMV digestive disease include: diarrhea, loss of appetite, fever, blood in the stool, stomach cramps, weight loss, painful swallowing, pain in the center of the chest.  In people with healthy immune systems:  Usually there are no simptoms  Sometimes a person with a healthy immune system may experience:  <ul> <li>Mononucleosis-like symptoms </li> <li>Mild hepatitis </li> <li>A rash </li> </ul> In immune compromised persons the following symptoms may be seen:  <ul> <li>pneumonia </li> <li>vision problems (any weakening of your eyesight, the appearance of ""floaters,"" small specks that move around in your field of vision, hazy vision, blurred or missing areas of vision) </li> <li>digestive problems (diarrhea, loss of appetite, fever, blood in the stool, stomach cramps, weight loss, painful swallowing, pain in the center of the chest.) </li> </ul> <h3>Diagnosis</h3> CMV infection causes your body to develop antibodies and these antibodies will be present for the rest of your life. Several tests are able to determine whether you have them or not. However, testing positive does not necessarily mean that your CMV infection is currently active. Other tests can be performed to confirm whether your symptoms are being caused by CMV. Eye examinations can determine whether you have CMV even before symptoms appear.<h3>How is it acquired?</h3> CMV is transmitted through saliva, urine, semen or other bodily fluids. It's not all that easy to catch and requires close contact with an infected person. It can also be spread through transplanted organs and sometimes blood infusions.  <h1 id=""treat"">How to treat it?</h1> Usually, it isn't treated and doesn't need to be. In the vast majority of cases, the disease is harmless and an infected person would not know that he or she had it.  If you have a compromised immune system, some drugs may be prescribed to keep your defenses as strong as possible and prevent you from getting active CMV. Other medications are prescribed to fight the infection, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. Unfortunately, these medications have serious side effects and are not always successful in curing the infection. They also have to be taken for the rest of the patient's life to ensure that the infection does not return.  One of the most promising developments in the treatment of CMV is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of anti-HIV drugs that strengthen the body's immune system. In a recent study, patients with CMV retinitis took HAART and were able to stop taking their usual anti-CMV medication without any further progression of the retinitis. The downside to HAART without anti-CMV medication is that after your strengthened immune system forces CMV retinitis into remission, the eye can become inflamed with Immune Recovery Uvetis (IRU), a disorder that can itself cause vision loss. If you have CMV retinitis and are undergoing HAART, your doctor might suggest that you continue your anti-CMV medication to prevent IRU.  <h1 id=""Prevention"">Prevention</h1> For most people with healthy immune systems, you shouldn't worry about CMV because it's usually harmless. Since the disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids, people who need to avoid CMV should be wary of them. That can be a real trick, of course, when 50-85 percent of the adult population has been infected. The Centers for Disease Control suggest that since CMV is spread frequently within households and between children at daycare centers, adults without the disease should be careful when interacting with children, changing diapers and other activities which might bring them into contact with bodily fluids. Don't share drinks or food. Use condoms. Wash your hands. Keep your immune system strong by eating well, exercising, and avoiding cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. CMV is a major cause of sickness and death for people with compromised immune systems such as: organ transplant recipients, people undergoing hemodialysis, people with cancer, people taking immunosuppressive drugs, and people with HIV. If a pregnant woman is infected with the virus for the first time during her pregnancy, the fetus is at risk of developing vision and hearing problems, difficulty with coordination, and mental retardation. There is no special risk to babies or children. People who work with children are more likely to catch the virus (from diapers, tissues, and such). In people with weakened immune systems, CMV can be very dangerous and sometimes fatal. It can cause retinitis (a disease of the eye that can lead to blindness), damage to the lungs, ulcers of the esophagus and lower intestines, diseases of the central nervous system, pneumonia and harm to other parts of the body. In severe cases of infection that endanger a person's life or vision, the drugs ganciclovir or foscarnet can be administered. However, the medications have serious side effects and do not always cure the infection. HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy)-a combination of anti-HIV drugs-has been effective in controlling CMV retinitis without requiring additional anti-CMV drugs. Unfortunately, the remission of retinitis as the result of HAART can cause a swelling in the eye (IRU) that itself can lead to vision problems. If you have HIV, you should be alert for any signs of CMV so that it can be treated as soon as possible. <h1 id=""Sex"">Sex</h1> Since CMV is spread through bodily fluids, you can get the disease by having sex with an infected person. Use a condom.  <h1 id=""Prevalence"">Prevalence</h1> In the United States, CMV infects between 50 to 85 percent of all adults by the age of 40. It is widespread throughout the world.",ComplicationsAIDS related Dementia ,"<p>This condition is known as AIDS dementia, and it can occur in people who have HIV and very weak immune systems. It occasionally strikes people with HIV who are relatively healthy.  <em>The signs of AIDS dementia started slowly in a friend of mine. First he couldn't remember phone numbers. Then one day in a taxi he forget his own address. He panicked and broke into a sweat. Finally he remembered his wallet, which had his address in it, and was able to make it home.</em></p><h3>What is it?</h3> AIDS dementia is a neurological disorder that affects your motor functions, memory and ability to think clearly or quickly. This condition gets its name from its most severe symptoms, which include psychosis or mania. Despite a protective system in our bodies called the blood-brain barrier, which generally keeps diseases away from the brain, HIV has found a way through. Experts believe that white brain cells, called macrophages, gobble up HIV and unwittingly smuggle it across the barrier, where it kills nerve cells. Dementia is the end result. <h3>Symptoms</h3> Forgetfulness is often the first sign of dementia. Other signs and symptoms of AIDS related dementia include: poor concentration, loss of memory (short or long-term), withdrawal, short attention span, slowed thinking, irritability, apathy, poor coordination, impaired judgment, vision problems, a change in personality, mania and psychosis. Symptoms are often subtle at first but can gradually worsen.  <h3>Diagnosis</h3> Your doctor may give you mental acuity and coordination tests to help gauge the extent of your neurological problems. Brain scans also identify any abnormalities.<h3>How is it acquired?</h3> AIDS dementia occurs when HIV attacks your brain's nerve cells, so anyone who contracts the HIV virus is susceptible to this condition. Often, the symptoms don't surface until your immune system is very weak, though sometimes it develops in people with HIV who are relatively healthy.  <h3>How to treat it?</h3><p> Unlike toxoplasmosis (toxo), a protozoal infection of the brain that can be treated with antibiotics, AIDS dementia is treated with antiviral medications that attack HIV. Your doctor may prescribe a drug cocktail (a therapy of multiple medications), which may reverse your symptoms of dementia. Brain scans, performed by your doctor on a regular basis, are a likely follow up to treatment, and a great way to red-flag any changes or abnormalities.  </p><p>The drug, AZT, which is commonly used to treat HIV, is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Some researchers believe that AZT, when taken in an early stage of HIV infection, can delay or even prevent the onset of AIDS related dementia. AZT should not be taken alone, but as part of a combination of several antiretroviral medications, sometimes called a ""cocktail"".<br /> </p><h3>Myths dispelled Immune Compromised Men</h3>  AIDS dementia is not the same as Alzheimer's disease, though many of the symptoms are identical. <h3>Prevention</h3><p> The best way to prevent AIDS related dementia is to avoid contracting HIV. If you do have the infection, your doctor may prescribe highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), or a drug cocktail. According to recent research, this therapy can help build up your immunity so your risk of dementia decreases, and it may even help to reverse some or all of your symptoms.  Keeping yourself healthy through diet and exercise is something all of us should do. </p><p>When you have HIV, it's particularly important to stay strong, because opportunistic conditions including dementia often appear at the later stages of the infection, when your T-cell count is low and your immune system is weak.  </p>",ComplicationsTuberculosis,,ComplicationsTo tell or not,"<p>More and more people are choosing to reveal their HIV status to the world. People like Olympic medalists Greg Louganis and Rudy Galindo, boxing titleholder Tommy Morrison, basketball superstar Magic Johnson, former New Republic magazine editor Andrew Sullivan, author and ACT UP founder Larry Kramer, MTV Ã¢â‚¬Å“Real WorldÃ¢â‚¬Â housemate Pedro Zamora, 1980s sitcom star JM J. Bullock, Broadway actors David Sabella and Ron Dennis, Hollywood's Michael Jeter and Karen Dior, country singer Doug Stevens, Playboy centerfold Rebekka Armstrong, porn stars Aiden Shaw and Tricia Devereaux, Mr. International Leather Joe Gallagher, New York City councilman Phil Reed, poet Vimal Jairath, all-American, GOP AIDS poster woman and single mom Mary Fisher, and retired journalist and grandmother Jane Fowler.<br /><br />That's quite a cross section of America Ã¢â‚¬â€œ white, people of color, gay, straight, male, female, and a transvestite. Famous or infamous, these people faced HIV disclosure in a very public way. Each time I facilitate a workshop or deliver a safer sex presentation, I disclose that I am HIV+. There have been times when I scanned a crowd of unfamiliar faces and wondered if they knew how fast my heart was racing and how close I came to throwing up on the front row. Even after having revealed myself to be a man living with HIV a hundred times, I still experience moments of anxiety. I occasionally fear the consequences of that revelation.<br /><br />Some HIV counselors advise people living with HIV to tell sexual partners prior to any intimate contact. Others may recommend that you operate on the assumption that everyone is HIV+. Laws regarding disclosure of HIV vary from state to state. In Georgia, where I live, the law is specific: an individual who knows he or she is infected with HIV and knowingly engages in intercourse without telling his/her HIV status is guilty of a felony.<br /><br />Regardless of what state laws may compel us to do or counselors recommend, this remains an agonizing, dreaded process for many HIV+ people. Disclosure is the only subject that gets a bigger rise (pardon the pun) out of my safer sex workshop participants than oral sex. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Should an HIV+ person always disclose his/her status to a potential sex partner?Ã¢â‚¬Â I ask. For every vehement NO there's an emphatic YES.<br /><br />Personally, I advocate disclosing prior to any sexual activity; it can save you a lot of heartache and headaches later. In discussing this issue with a wide variety of people, infected and affected, I have discovered that the moment of truth is much easier after you come to terms emotionally with your own HIV status. If you are ashamed to be HIV+, it will be obvious. If you present yourself as damaged, that's exactly how you'll be perceived and treated. This is a human condition. Accept it. When you come to terms with being positive you can convey that confidence to others.<br /><br />Besides presentation, timing is important. Let's say you meet most of your sexual partners in a bar. Is it really comfortable to disclose this sort of thing over a disco beat in the middle of a dark, smoky bar? Why not excuse yourself for a breath of fresh air and ask him or her to accompany you outside. Unless you're in Tonight's- the- Night mode, exchange phone numbers and meet for coffee in a quieter, more accommodating location at a later time. Or maybe you meet sexual partners online. Think about including your HIV status in your profile Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that can weed out those for whom itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a problem right away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or work it into your chat before you meet. Disclosing HIV status in a neutral location is a good idea. Disclosing in the bedroom, naked and horny, is not. Be casual and confident, but do it before sex. And come at it from a position of strength.<br /><br />Don't expect disclosure to necessarily get easier. Reactions can vary and people can surprise you. Rejection is always a possibility. One way to handle rejection is to depersonalize it. Remind yourself that the other person is actually rejecting the virus. If someone is not mentally prepared to deal with your HIV status, acknowledge it and move on. Who knows what their issues are?<br /><br />At first, I was one of those people who said we're all better off just assuming everyone else is HIV+, but an old friend gave me a new perspective. He said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I'm still negative after all these years. Not because I'm lucky, but because I work at it consistently. I've put a lot of energy into being safe and protecting myself, so I kind of resent it when someone wants to pretend I'm positive for their own peace of mind or just so they can avoid having a real conversation about it.Ã¢â‚¬Â I was glad my friend shared his feelings with me because it prompted me to rethink my own position about disclosure. I think he gently reminded me that honesty is still a virtue and we can choose to live our lives with integrity.<br /><br />Disclosure can be scary, embarrassing or painful. I know; I've been there. But candid conversation usually leads to informed decisions and better sexual relationships. There can be something genuinely liberating about telling the truth and letting people know who you really are.<br /><br />David Salyer is an HIV+ journalist, educator and activist living in Atlanta, Georgia. He leads Conscious Sex presentations for men and women and has facilitated workshops for people living with HIV since 1994.</p>",HIV POZ 101Positive and Positive Sex,"  But regardless of the HIV status of the partner, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important for someone who is HIV positive to think about protecting their own health as well, by avoiding exposure to other STDs, such as hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, parasites, and herpes, which can weaken the immune system, and make life more difficult.<br /><br />Another issue that has raised concern lately regarding positive / positive sex is the possibility of acquiring different strains of HIV from your partner.  Though research has only been able to identify a very small number of cases where re-infection has occurred, at this point in time researchers vary in their opinion about whether re-infection really exists.<br />",HIV POZ 101Positive and Negative Sex,"You can have HIV and enjoy a full and satisfying sexual  life. People with HIV do have sex and do enjoy healthy relationships.  There are a number of myths or misconceptions that exist which can  lead men to take risks when they are having sex. Being aware of the  risks is an important step in protecting yourself from sexually transmitted  infections and other strains of HIV.  <p>Some guys believe that if they have an undetectable viral load they  cannot transmit the virus to others. This is a false belief. Your  viral load measures the amount of HIV in your blood. The amount of  HIV in your blood can vary from the amount of HIV in your cum. There  is no way to predict how much virus is present in your cum on any  given day. </p><p>The amount can vary depending on such factors as your overall  state of health or the stage of your HIV infection. You can have an  undetectable viral load and have enough virus in your cum to transmit  the virus to someone else.  Some guys believe that if they are having sex with someone and neither  of them brings up condoms, then they must have the same HIV status.  They may believe that guys with HIV would never fuck without a condom.  </p><p>Similarly they may believe that someone who does not have HIV would  never fuck without a condom. But, both of these beliefs are false.  Sometimes guys with HIV do fuck without condoms and sometimes guys  who do not have HIV fuck without condoms. Don't assume your partner's  HIV status.  It is a myth that the guy getting fucked cannot give HIV to the guy  who is fucking him. Both the top and the bottom are at high risk for  HIV if they fuck without a condom. </p><p>Excerpt From: <em>Sex and being positive</em> By David Klotz</p>",HIV POZ 101Mental health and HIV,"The important thing is to break the isolation.

However, especially now that people are living longer with HIV, it's important to deal with all of your health issues. For this reason, you might prefer to have a family practitioner or a specialist in internal medicine as your primary physician. No matter what their specialty, you will get better HIV care from doctors who have experience treating people at all stages of HIV disease. Be sure to ask how many patients the doctor has treated with HIV, and how many they currently see. HIV patients do better when their physicians have more experience treating HIV disease.<br />  <h3>Do you have similar ideas about treating HIV? </h3>Some doctors are more conservative, and prefer ""tried and true"" methods. Others are more aggressive, more willing to try new and experimental treatments. Some are optimistic by nature, and always stress the hopeful or positive side when they talk about test results or future prospects. Others are more realistic; some are pessimistic. Some doctors are comfortable suggesting ""complementary and alternative"" therapies such as massage, acupuncture, or herbs. Others stick strictly to western medicine. If you want a lot of emotional support, you probably won't be comfortable with a doctor who only talks about test results. The more comfortable you are with your doctor's approach to HIV treatments, the easier it will be for you to get the kind of healthcare you want. Talk to doctors and their patients before you make your choice. <br /> <h3>The doctor -- patient relationship </h3>Many patients do better when they take an active role in planning their own health care. These patients do a lot of reading on their own, and bring information to their doctors. The patient and doctor work together to make health care decisions. Other patients are more comfortable with the doctor making important decisions. Decide how you want to work with your doctor, and see if that fits with the way the doctor likes to work with patients.<br /> <h3>Availability</h3><p>The best doctors won't do you any good if you can't get in to see them. Ask the doctor (or their receptionist) how long it usually takes to get an appointment, and how well the doctor stays on schedule during the day. The type of insurance you have could limit your choice of a doctor. </p><p>Maybe the doctor isn't on the list for your health maintenance organization (HMO) or insurance plan. Be sure to find out how you will be able to pay for the doctor's services. Remember, if a good HIV doctor is hard to find, or if it's hard to get an appointment, you can use another physician - or a physician's assistant or a nurse practitioner - to help you with most of your health care needs. Just be sure that when you are dealing with HIV issues, you are dealing with an experienced HIV doctor. <br /> </p><h3>Confidentiality </h3>Some people are very concerned about keeping their HIV status private. You might choose to get your HIV care from a doctor in another town to protect your privacy. You will need to find your own balance between confidentiality and convenience.<br /> <h3>Help your doctor help you </h3><p>Make sure that your doctor has all the information needed to give the best advice about your treatment. This starts with your medical records, which may have to be transferred from another doctor's office. When you start working with a new doctor, they will probably do a lot of tests to collect ""baseline"" information. This helps you see how well you're doing as time goes by. Be sure your doctor knows how you feel about using medications, and about your illness. Some people don't mind taking a lot of pills; other people would rather take as few as possible. </p><p>Your doctor should also know about other treatments you are using or want to try, including non-medical ones. Be honest about your lifestyle. Your eating, sleeping, and work patterns can make a difference for your health care. So can your sexual practices and use of recreational drugs. If your doctor seems too judgmental, try to change doctors. It's better to have a doctor who really knows you instead of holding back information. Let your doctor know about the important people in your life: the people who will support you if you get sick, or will help you make important medical decisions.  </p><h3>Changing doctors </h3>Your health care needs will probably change as time goes by. Also, your ideas about treatment could change. Although you will probably get better medical care from a provider who has known you for a long time, you always have the right to stop seeing one provider and change to another.  <br /> <h3>To find a doctor ...</h3> <p>You can get help finding a doctor or a case manager, click on this link to be redirected to the Four A's website.Ã‚Â <a href=""http://www.alaskanaids.org/alaskanaids_new/clientresources.html"">Four A's - Client Resources</a>Ã‚Â  </p><h3>The bottom line</h3>HIV medical care is very complicated, and changes very rapidly. This makes it important to find an HIV doctor who works with HIV/AIDS patients and is committed to staying up to date. Your relationship with an HIV doctor will be better if you are comfortable with each other's personal style and approach to dealing with health issues in general, and HIV in particular",Support & CarePartner Contact and Referral Services,"<p> A local public health (PH) specialist  can provide you counseling and practice about how to notify partners  yourself, or they perform this potentially unpleasant task for you,  if the person(s) needing to be contacted live at a distance or are  people youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d prefer not to contact or to tell that you have  HIV. </p><p>The PH specialist will work with you to find identifiers (e.g.,  name, address, and phone number of people (""contacts"") who  you think may have been exposed or may be HIV-infected. Then the PH  specialist will work to locate each contact to tell them that they  may have been exposed to someone with HIV and could be at risk. </p><p>They  will advise these contacts to be tested for HIV and will generally  provide the opportunity for HIV counseling and testing right then  and there. The PH specialist will never disclose the name of the person  who has tested positive, but in some cases, it will may be obvious  to the contact who has identified them, particularly if they have  had sex with only one or few other people. </p><p> PCRS in this country is always a completely voluntary process in that no public health professionals will coerce or in any way require you to name partners. However, notifying partners that they may have HIV is extremely important from two perspectives: </p><p>First, knowledge of having HIV can be life-saving, as the infection will progress to AIDS and potentially life-threatening consequences that can be prevented with current treatments, if the person knows about his/her infection. </p><p>Secondly, knowledge of HIV infection enables the person to take steps to prevent transmission of virus to others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an extremely important bit of information to prevent new infections. PCRS programs are not new; they have been used for years with tuberculosis, syphilis, and other potentially dangerous, communicable diseases.  </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",HIV POZ 101"HIV+ Test, Now what?","  <h3>Emotional support</h3>Emotional support may be very important for HIV-positive people because it breaks the isolation and provides a safe way of sharing both feelings and practical information. People have their own ""families of choice"" from which they receive emotional support. Options for emotional support are: <ul> <li>friends, family, lovers, partners </li> <li>individual HIV positive people </li> <li>one-on-one counseling </li> <li>support groups</li>  </ul> In general, support groups meet on a regular basis to talk about common experiences. Support groups may be ""closed"" (once a group is formed, no new members are accepted), or ""open"" / drop-in (new members are allowed to join at any time). Support groups usually have a facilitator, who may be a professional or a member of the group.<h3>Medical care</h3> Once you find a doctor or clinic, your main objective is to get an evaluation of your general health and immune function. Many doctors do the following: <ul> <li>Administer lab tests to evaluate your immune system. </li>  <li>Determine if you have other diseases that might become problematic in the future, including syphilis, TB, hepatitis-B, MAI, and toxoplasmosis.</li>  </ul> If you are already infected with one or more of these other illnesses, there may be treatments or prophylaxis available to prevent it from becoming more serious or recurring in the future. If you're not already infected, doctors may be able to prevent future infection by:  <ul> <li>administering vaccines. Many HIV positive people get a hepatitis-B vaccine and bacterial pneumonia vaccines, since contracting these diseases could be dangerous for immune suppressed people. </li>  <li>prescribing antiviral treatments and protease inhibitors when tests show immune system impairment. </li>  <li>scheduling regular checkups. Checkups may be scheduled every three to six months. Some people need more frequent check-ups, particularly when they are starting new antiviral drugs.</li></ul><h3>Healthy habits</h3> Most doctors advise HIV-positive people to improve their everyday habits, which gives their body a better chance of staying healthy. In general: <ul> <li>eat a balanced diet </li> <li>get plenty of sleep </li> <li>get regular exercise </li> <li>reduce (or stop) the intake of alcohol and recreational drugs </li> <li>avoid smoking </li> </ul> Healthy habits also include safer sex and needle cleaning to avoid other diseases, and because re-infection with HIV may accelerate the progression to AIDS.",HIV POZ 101The psychological complexities of the HIV+ man,"Accordingly, I've decided to list a baker's dozen of the major issues I've encountered in talking with hundreds of HIV positive men over the past decade. These are the variables that determine the unique, personal shape of the disease's shadow on their lives. I believe that only through the process of understanding and honoring their individual circumstances can that shadow be lifted, and healing occur. In the interest of simplicity, I will be referring primarily to how HIV/AIDS impacts gay men, as they form the bulk of my clinical practice and are also the vast majority of the readers of this publication. <br />  <h3>Age</h3> <strong>AGE:</strong> HIV's psychological impact can be vastly different on a man in his 20s than on a man in his 40s. For a younger man, the diagnosis is generally much harder to take. Not only does it complicate the ""my best years are ahead of me"" thinking, but it can feel much more isolating. Older men often find some solace in the memory of friends and lovers who've suffered before them, a comfort seldom accessible to the younger guy, who may not know anyone who's openly positive or who's died of the disease. <br /> <h3>Anxiety</h3> <strong>ANXIETY: </strong>  It's hard to imagine a condition more anxiety provoking than HIV. In addition to the worries about declining health, bodily deterioration, and the possibility of premature death, there are anxiety-producing situations that someone who's HIV positive may confront many times on a daily basis: Did I remember to take my pills? How far is the nearest toilet? Should I tell this guy that I'm positive? Not to mention longer-term worries: is my face looking gaunter? If I lose my job, what will I do about medical insurance? Should I worry about planning for retirement?  <h3>Career</h3> <strong>CAREER: </strong>  Living with HIV can be devastating to one's ability to pursue a career, particularly in a fast-paced or stressful field. As men, many of us are raised believing that our worth is measured by what we do for a living, and how successful we are at it. So when someone decides (or is told) that working sixty hours a week has to come to an end, he's liable to react with despair. Even more common today is the reverse scenario: men who went out on disability or cashed in their life insurance five or ten years ago, counting on living out their last days in relative comfort and peace, only to be faced with the necessity of reentering the work force now that their HIV is under control. But how? How to bring rusty skills up-to-date? How to explain the employment hiatus? Finally, there's the dilemma of feeling trapped in a job that is no longer fulfilling, but that can't be left because the insurance benefits are so important  <h3>Change</h3> <strong>CHANGE: </strong>  The single greatest cause of psychological stress is change. In time, people can adapt to almost any circumstance (think of prisoners of war or concentration camp survivors), but the initial period of adjustment is always challenging. Many people with HIV struggle with what seems an almost unending series of changes, not only in their laboratory ""markers"" (i.e. viral load, T-cell count), or in the fade-in and out of symptoms such as neuropathy, but also in their ability to deal with the volatile side effects of medications - medications that also change as the virus mutates. The only constant in their health picture is their lifelong HIV infection: no cure is in sight, and so they face the eternal, irrevocable sentence: HIV POSITIVE.  <h3>Cowardice</h3> <strong>COWARDICE: </strong>  Starting a couple of years ago, the media began promulgating the notion that ""the epidemic is over"". After all, thanks to protease inhibitors, death rates had fallen dramatically, hospital wards were empty, and the walking skeletons that used to populate the streets of West Hollywood, the Castro, and Greenwich Village had disappeared. The average American (straight and gay) stopped worrying so much about the AIDS epidemic, and the disease started assuming a more benign face. As a result, someone who's HIV positive today can feel like a coward for worrying about his health and his life expectancy, particularly if he's being reassured by friends, family, and maybe even his doctor that HIV is now not such a ""big deal"". Yet HIV is a still a very serious and dangerous disease. <h3>Denial</h3> <strong>DENIAL: </strong>  For some, the idea of being HIV+ is so frightening or abhorrent that they may act as if they never received a diagnosis. This denial can take various destructive forms: I've seen men who only occasionally ""partied"" with recreational substances suddenly develop a major addiction to smoking crystal. Men who heretofore sexually played safely turn to frequent acts of unsafe/unprotected sex. Or they may delay visiting a doctor until they're so sick that they have to be hospitalized.  <h3>God</h3> <strong>GOD: </strong>  Living with HIV is at its core an existential dilemma: how to make meaning of an unexpected, unfair twist of fate. Those who can turn to a ""higher power"", either through pre-existing belief or through cultivating a spiritual practice (e.g. yoga or meditation) generally fare much better in dealing with their condition than ""non-believers"". A not insignificant number of HIV+ men credit their infection with ultimately re-directing their lives in a direction that has given them not only solace and meaning, but even glimpses of (non-pharmaceutical) ecstasy.  <h3>Grief</h3> <strong>GRIEF: </strong>  Someone who's HIV positive generally goes into an extended state of mourning, and may experience the loss of many previously wonderful aspects of life: the exuberance of being gay and the celebration of one's sexuality, the prospect of a future of good health, a general sense of optimism and even immortality. Finding a way to say ""goodbye"" to these aspects, while finding a place within to cherish their memories, is the key to emerging from the grief and re-engaging in life.  <br /> <h3>Guilt and shame</h3> <strong>GUILT and SHAME: </strong>  HIV can foster guilt in a way that a Jewish mother could only envy. ""How could I have been so stupid - it's not like I don't know how it's transmitted"" is usually where this guilt starts, from which point it may well continue its unrelenting pursuit in various guises. If someone is feeling depressed, yet is relatively healthy, he might be ashamed to voice his feelings: ""I shouldn't complain, after all, so many people are worse off than I am."" If someone has remained relatively healthy for many years, he may feel guilty for having outlived all of those who succumbed earlier. And there's the question of when, and if, to come out of the HIV closet to family, friends, potential sexual partners and/or casual dates. Unfortunately, but understandably, there will often be a reluctance to turn to friends and family for support, which is the one thing most needed to help heal the psychic pain.  <br /> <h3>Internalized homophobia</h3> <strong>INTERNALIZED HOMOPHOBIA: </strong>  Having grown up in a society which condemns and even abhors homosexuality (""faggot"" is <strong>still</strong>  an acceptable put-down in school), we all carry with us a degree of self-hatred for our attraction to other men. And, in some of us, this self-hatred can be immense (particularly if raised in a fire-and-brimstone Fundamentalist environment, be that Seventh Day Adventist, Southern Baptist, Roman Catholic or Orthodox Jewish). Becoming infected with HIV can re-trigger this self-hatred, magnifying all of those feelings of self-loathing, since it's hard to avoid the conclusion that ""if I hadn't acted on my sexual impulses I wouldn't have become infected."" <br /> <h3>Loss of control</h3> <strong>LOSS OF CONTROL: </strong>  Most of us labor under the delusion that we're in control of our life circumstances, a delusion that can be maintained as long as nothing catastrophic occurs. HIV is, to many, that very catastrophe. Suddenly it seems like an alien agent (the HIV virus) is in charge of their lives. The totally powerless feeling that results has been described to me as ""like being a passenger in a car on the 405 whose driver just had a heart attack"". <br /> <h3>Medical advances</h3> <strong>MEDICAL ADVANCES: </strong>  Ironically, while someone who's positive is <strong>medically</strong>  much better off today than in the 1980s, it may have actually been easier for some people infected then to deal with the psychological impact of living with HIV. At that time, HIV was almost assuredly a death sentence, and those who were positive were viewed, at least by many in our community, as martyrs or heroes, ""diseased"" though they might be. That was a context in which fear and suffering could be endured. Today, people who are HIV positive are no longer martyrs or heroes, but they remain ""diseased"". And medical advances have enabled many of those infected to look healthy, or even better than before (thanks to testosterone therapy) - even when they're not feeling that way. So sympathy is harder to come by. <br /> <h3>Self-esteem</h3> <strong>SELF-ESTEEM: </strong>  ""I feel like tainted goods"" is a phrase that I hear over and over again when working with HIV+ men. And is it any wonder? In an effort to secure the research and funding attention that was so necessary in the 1980s, AIDS activists promulgated the concept of the disease as a plague. Yet the very success of that effort has left in its wake a tremendous psychological casualty: the already fragile self-esteem of so many gay men has become even further eroded as they discover that they're liable to be shunned by their peers. Perhaps this facet of living with HIV is best summed up by the short sentence featured in so many Internet profiles and personal ads: ""I'm healthy - UB2"". Perhaps an HIV+ guy will never fully fit that bill. But a balanced quest for physical, emotional, and spiritual health can help create a life very much worth living.",HIV POZ 101Positive/negative relationships,"<br />So how did he end up with an HIV-negative lover three years later? He found out that his heart couldn't tell a negative guy from a positive one, and he fell in love with someone whose status wasn't the same as his. Does it make a difference, I asked him?<br /><br />""Not usually,"" he said. ""But there are timesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.""<br /><br />Some men are just too worried about the possibility of infection to get involved with someone whose HIV status is different from their own. And men with a strong desire to take a partner's cum inside them are generally going to need to stick with someone of the same HIV status. For others, though, HIV isn't a make-or-break issue when it comes to dating and relating.<br /><br />Ten years ago, HIV seemed like a death sentence to many gay men. Now, more and more men with HIV are living healthy and relatively normal lives. Living longer and healthier means more opportunity for relationships. And compared with years past, nowadays the distinction between positive and negative doesn't seem so great to many men. Too many couples still don't have role models for healthy male-male relationships. And mixed- HIV status couples? Fewer models still, unless you count the tragedies and melodramas that seem as out-of-date as ""Love Story.""<br /><br />Living with HIV is different for each couple, but researchers have found some common threads.<br /><br />One way HIV makes relationships more difficult is that some guys in mixed couples find less support from friends and family - either out of fear for the uninfected partner or concern that the positive guy is going to be abandoned if the going gets rough. Since social support is important in most relationships, couples need to find ways to deal with this head-on by being frank with family and friends: they expect support and encouragement, not judgment or attitude.<br /><br />In fact, HIV can have a positive impact in relationships if it causes people to maintain a focus on what is most important in life. HIV can push partners to live in the present moment - not because there is no future, but because the future may be uncertain. That's true for all people, but living with HIV can underscore that ambiguity.<br /><br />It's probably no surprise that sex is the area of intimate relationships that is most directly impacted by HIV. Someone unwilling to take any risks at all is going to find it tricky to be in a mixed-status relationship, but how do the guys involved decide what is safe for them - or what risks they are willing to tolerate?<br /><br />Talking things through helps. How important is anal sex, for instance? What kinds of things does each partner absolutely have to do in order to have the kind of sex life that's important to him? Couples who want to fuck and who want the HIV negative guy to stay that way are going to need to accept condoms as a permanent part of their sex lives. Mixed status couples can have great sex if they are honest about their needs and desires and if they are willing to be creative in bed.<br /><br />Some couples find that they avoid topics that emphasize their differentness from one another. Talking about things like retirement, aging or even changing jobs may feel awkward for the HIV negative partner. Similarly, the positive partner may hold back in talking about their anxieties, symptoms or medical problems for fear of seeming like they are ""always talking about AIDS."" Often there is a desire to avoid emotionally charged issues like health care regimens, illness, disability or death based on a desire to ""protect"" the other partner from potentially ugly reality.<br /><br />The friend I mentioned earlier found that he and his partner were avoiding any talk about HIV. They got into couples counseling for something unrelated. ""We found out that we each were avoiding talking about it to protect the other guy,"" he said. ""How stupid was that? I mean, there were times when I really could have used his support, but I was too chickenshit to tell him I was scared."" My friend's partner had his own fears. They learned they weren't protecting one another - they were simply avoiding conflict.<br /><br />While new medical treatments have certainly made life with HIV better, they can also cause new stresses for the couple. The regimens can be complicated, and side effects are sometimes nasty. Treatments affect sexual desire differently, and usually not for the better. And there is both more hope and more uncertainty about living with HIV than ever before. The uncertainty can increase stress around issues related to future life together.<br /><br />It is important for mixed-status couples to not let HIV become the determining factor in decisions about moving, financial planning, changing jobs, having children or anything else. The HIV-positive partner may need to let go of anxieties or guilt about being a burden or victim. And if the HIV-negative partner has codependent fantasies of being the rescuer or savior, he's going to have to get rid of them as well. It's important to find ways to express hopes and fears with the other partner in a way that lowers barriers and builds intimacy. Talking about things helps - maybe talking things over with a counselor.",HIV POZ 101Dealing with side effects," These changes are commonly referred to as HIV-related Lipodystrophy, and their cause and possible remedy are a major focus of current AIDS research.<h3>Changes to your body</h3>Ever since AIDS was first documented in the early 1980's, one of the scariest and frustrating experiences for people living with HIV has been changes they experience in their body weight, size, and shape. [Actually, lipodystrophy has only been recognized for about 6 years. Earlier, before combination treatment, significant weight loss was generally a precursor of demise, itself even more scary than lipodystrophy.] For the first 15 years of the AIDS epidemic, weight loss and wasting syndrome were some of the most common symptoms of HIV infection, particularly in people with certain opportunistic infections (OIs). And while triple-drug anti-HIV therapy has helped to greatly reduce the risk of either weight loss or wasting syndrome, both continue to occur today. [but not as often to death as before.]<br />Unfortunately, body-shape and body-size changes in people with HIV did not stop with fewer cases of weight loss and wasting syndrome. A new complication of HIV Ã¢â‚¬â€œ believed to be a side effect of anti-HIV therapy, or of longer-term infection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ has become a major issue of people living with HIV over the past three years: lipodystrophy. The body-shape changes associated with lipodystrophy, along with fat and sugar problems in the blood, are being seen in a large number of HIV-positive people currently taking anti-HIV treatments. And while researchers are still scrambling to make sense of lipodystrophy, including its possible causes, information about this problem and the things that might be done about it continues to surface.<h3>Lipodystrophy</h3><p>More than just a tongue-twisting word, the term ""lipodystrophy"" can be broken down to reveal exactly what it means. ""Lipo"" refers to fat and ""dystrophy"" refers to abnormal growth or change.  </p><p>In reality, lipodystrophy refers to a number of different problems. While researchers or health-care providers still have not yet officially defined lipodystrophy, it generally refers to any of the following:</p><p>A build up of fat: Some people see an increase in the amount of fat around their gut, and/or on the back of their neck & shoulders (sometimes referred to as a ""Buffalo Hump""), and/or in their breasts, especially in women with HIV. The gut fat has been given unscientific nicknames by its earliest sufferers, such as ""Crixy Belly"", or ""Protease Paunch"", since it first became prevalent in those taking Crixivan, one of the earliest and most commonly used protease inhibitors.</p><p>A loss of fat: Some people see the fat in their legs, arms, buttocks, or face diminish. This can cause veins to protrude in the arms and legs and sunken cheeks and temples in the face and head. </p><p>High levels of fats in the blood: Some people have an increased amount of fat, or lipids, in their blood. The two types of lipids that increase are triglycerides and cholesterol.</p><p>High levels of sugar in the blood: Some people have seen the amount of sugar, or glucose, in their blood increase. This may also be associated with an increase in the amount of insulin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a hormone produced by the pancreas to help control glucose levels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in the blood. This can lead to diabetes, a potentially dangerous problem that requires medical attention.</p><h3>Wasting</h3><p>Weight loss and wasting syndrome are two AIDS-related complications that, if not adequately treated, can be life threatening. Even though anti-HIV therapies have helped reduce the risk of weight loss and wasting syndrome, both problems still occur. According to a study reported in late 1997, as many as 25% of HIV-positive people receiving triple-drug anti-HIV therapy still experience some degree of weight loss and/or wasting.</p><strong>Is there a difference between weight loss and wasting?</strong> Yes. As its name implies, weight loss refers to a loss of body weight. Wasting syndrome refers to a loss of body mass or size, most notably muscle mass (sometimes referred to as ""lean body mass""). Very often, both occur at the same time. However, this is not always the case. It is possible that someone who is losing weight might not lose muscle mass. It is also possible that someone losing muscle mass might not lose a lot of weight.<p> For example, some HIV-positive people lose a lot of muscle. Yet they may experience an increase in fat. This can cause weight to stay the same, even though muscle wasting is going on.In people who do not have HIV, weight loss is not usually a serious problem. For example, someone who goes on a diet will eventually lose weight. </p><p>To make up for the lack of food being eaten, the body will naturally burn fat - either in the blood or stored in cells - to help meet its energy needs. At the same time, the body works to protect protein during periods of dieting or physical activity. Protein is needed to build muscle, cells, and organs in the body. In other words, most people can afford to lose fat. They cannot afford to lose protein.In people with HIV, especially during periods of illness (e.g., MAC or tuberculosis), the energy demands of the body increase. </p><p>Turning fat into energy also requires a lot of work in the body. To help save energy, the body may go after protein to fuel its energy needs. This is because protein is much easier to convert into energy than fat. Also, protein is needed to help repair damaged organs and to replace immune system cells lost during periods of illness.If there isn't enough protein in the blood - which might occur if someone is not eating all the protein they should during times of illness - the body will go after a major source of protein in the body: muscle. Depending on the energy needs of the body, which depends on how severe or how long the illness lasts, either a little or a lot of muscle can be lost. And while the loss of small amounts of muscle is not usually serious, losing large amounts of muscle can be dangerous.</p><p>There are, essentially, two different types of wasting. The first type reflects periods of rapid weight loss and muscle wasting. As discussed above, this type is most commonly found in people experiencing particular opportunistic infections (OIs), such as MAC, tuberculosis, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Given the benefits of anti-HIV therapy and prophylaxis, people living with HIV now stand a much better chance of either avoiding or recovering faster from an OI. This is certainly good news in terms of preventing one of the most common types of wasting.The second type reflects more gradual losses in both weight and muscle. Unlike the first type, which most often applies to people with AIDS, gradual wasting can occur at any time. It can also occur for any number of reasons and may be due to HIV infection itself</p><h3>Feeling tired (Fatigue & Anemia)</h3>Fatigue is a general term used to describe feelings of exhaustion, sleepiness, and lack of energy. It is a common problem among HIV-infected people. Fatigue is not a disease, but rather a symptom of disease. Some people suffer from isolated or periodic bouts of exhaustion. Others, however, experience chronic fatigue, which may greatly interfere with work or other day-to-day activities. Many health-care providers do not know how to manage HIV-positive patients who report fatigue. Often, patients are told that their fatigue is either ""in their heads"" or an unavoidable consequence of being infected with HIV. Not only do many types of fatigue benefit from treatment or changes in lifestyle, but negative health-care provider attitudes about fatigue can also significantly impair the relationship between HIV-positive patients and their caregivers.<h3>Peripheral Neuropathy</h3><p>Peripheral neuropathy results from injury to the peripheral nerves in the body. These nerves carry signals between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal column) and the muscles, skin, and internal organs. When peripheral neuropathy first develops, people often report a tingling or prickling in the toes, although it can also start in the fingers. Over time, the tingling gradually spreads up the feet or hands and worsens into a burning, shooting, and/or throbbing pain. People who have severe peripheral neuropathy may experience extreme pain and may have difficulty walking, sometimes requiring the assistance of a cane or wheelchair to move around.</p><p>People who have peripheral neuropathy usually experience symptoms on both sides of their bodies. In other words, peripheral neuropathy almost always occurs in both feet and/or both hands. The sensations can be either constant or periodic. Sometimes they may not be noticeable, while at other times they may be extremely bothersome.</p><p>Not only can peripheral neuropathy be physically painful, it can also have a profound effect on quality of life. The natural instinct to avoid or reduce pain can prevent people from going about their regular day-to-day activities, whether it be going up and down stairs, visiting with family or friends, or going to work. This can cause a great deal of anxiety and can lead to serious depression Ã¢â‚¬â€œ serious emotional problems that can make life seem altogether frustrating [Peripheral neuropathy may result from HIV itself, but frequently is a side effect (particularly of the ""d"" drugs -- ddI, d4T, ddc. If drug-induced, it may reverse after removing the offending drug. Treatment with anti-depressants is often effective.)]</p><h3>Sick to your stomach (Nausea & Diarrhea)</h3><p>When it comes to side effects of HIV medications, the gastrointestinal tract -- the gut -- is one of the most commonly effected organ systems in the human body. The reason for this is simple: the gut is one of the body's first immune defenses, with the intent of allowing healthy nutrients into the body and keeping potentially harmful toxins and germs out. Although anti-HIV medicines are designed to fight HIV and ultimately do the body good, the gut considers these drugs to be harmful and will sometimes turn on its defense mechanisms to clear them from the body.Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are three ways in which the gut deals with toxins it considers harmful. </p><p>These are important defense mechanisms, as they help keep dangerous germs -- such as bacteria, viruses, and other bugs -- as well as truly harmful chemicals, out of the body. Unfortunately, these mechanisms can backfire when dealing with lifesaving medicines. While we may recognize medicines as being helpful, it can take the gut some time to figure this out. In the process, the gut goes about ""business as usual,"" responding in some rather unpleasant ways to the onslaught of anti-HIV drugs.If nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting are severe or prolonged, they can lead to serious health problems and can prevent anti-HIV meds from entering the bloodstream and from doing what they need to do. </p><p>This is especially true for HIV-positive people experiencing these symptoms due to an underlying AIDS-related infection or complication. Thus it's always best to report these symptoms to your doctor, to determine if they are a side effect of treatment or a symptom of something more serious. Fortunately, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea -- when they occur as side effects of anti-HIV treatment -- are usually mild, and tend to diminish after the first few days or weeks of treatment. But this does not mean that you need to simply live with these problems. </p><p>They can have a serious impact on your quality of life and the way you go about your day-to-day activities, and they can have a negative effect on the way you view your treatment. For some HIV-positive people, these side effects can linger for several weeks, months, or years!</p><h3>Opportunistic infections (OIs)</h3><p>AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is a condition caused by a virus called HIV. This virus attacks the immune system, the body's ""security force"" that fights off infections.

Finally, phase IV studies may test several different approved  treatments to find out if one is better than others. Although participating in a study may be a useful part of your treatment,  it is important to know that the main purpose of the trial is to test  the treatment</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",MedicationsAdhering to Your Regimen,"Not taking the medicines properly can lead to ""drug resistance"", where HIV mutates and becomes resistant to a drug's effect. This in turn leads to treatment failure. Therefore, it's important to plan adherence strategies in advance.<p>You should raise questions about treatment adherence with your doctor when you're deciding what treatments to take. Different drugs have different rules Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some drugs need to be taken only once a day, while other drugs must be taken two or three times a day. Some drugs must be taken on an empty stomach, while others must be taken with a high-fat meal. Because you will probably be taking several different medications, each drug will have different rules. It's important to know and pay close attention to which drug goes with which rules.</p><h3>Understanding drug resistance & the test to measure it</h3>All available anti-HIV drugs work by preventing HIV from reproducing within your body. However, when HIV continues to reproduce during treatment, the virus can alter itself (or ""mutate"") to avoid the drugs. This is called ""drug resistance."" If drug resistance occurs, then the drugs can't block the HIV from reproducing, and the medicine gradually becomes useless. Therefore, it's important to prevent HIV from reproducing during drug treatment.<br /><h3>What causes drug resistance?</h3><p>There are a number of reasons that drug resistance develops, however the three most important causes are:</p><p>1. Poor treatment adherence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that is, not taking all the medicines at the proper time intervals and in the correct ways (that is, with or without the right foods, as prescribed).</p><p>2. Weak treatment regimens. Doctors usually prescribe combinations of several different anti-HIV medicines in order to prevent drug resistance. If the drugs prescribed aren't strong enough to block HIV almost completely, then drug resistance will probably develop.</p><p>3. Low drug levels. For some reason, different people taking the same dose of the same medicine will often process those medicines differently. This can result in low levels of medicine, and the resulting anti-HIV activity will be weak.</p>",MedicationsThe big treatment questions ,"<p>This may be the right option for you, but it's usually worth  taking your time to learn about the drugs before you make a decision  about starting treatment. Sometimes HIV-positive people can be healthy  and stable for a long time without medication. In the US government's  guidelines on HIV-treatment, the most important instruction about  starting treatment is often overlooked: treatment should begin when  you are ready.</p><p>Deciding when to start anti-HIV treatment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and figuring out which drugs to start with Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is, perhaps, one of the most difficult decisions you will need to make. And, depending on which way you look at it, the fact that everyone has different opinions regarding these issues can be either helpful, frustrating, or a combination of both. Learning all you can about the pros and cons of your various treatment options is your best weapon in the fight against HIV.</p><h3>Why is treatment necessary? </h3><p>If HIV is allowed to reproduce, or ""replicate,"" inside the body, it  may gradually cause damage to the immune system. Ultimately, the immune  system gets so weak that the body becomes vulnerable to other life-threatening  diseases. This is the point at which a person is usually diagnosed  with full-blown AIDS. </p><p>For adults who live in wealthy nations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  such as the United States Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the average time between becoming  infected with HIV and the development of AIDS is about 10 years. This does not, however, include people who take anti-HIV drugs. Clinical  trials Ã¢â‚¬â€œ studies in which new and old drugs are tested in humans  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have repeatedly shown that anti-HIV drugs can keep HIV-infected  people alive much longer on average. Treatment, therefore, is a very  important option, and people living with the virus should consider  starting treatment before HIV has had a chance to do serious damage  to their immune systems.<br /> </p><h3>When will I know that it's time to start treatment?</h3><p> There's really no right or wrong answer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it all depends on the individual.  Working closely with your doctor, you can determine when the best  time is to start treatment. This will largely depend on two factors:  your physical health and your mental readiness to start therapy and  stick with it closely. In terms of physical health, your viral load count, T-cell count,  and how you feel will each play a major role in figuring out when  to start. </p><p>Along with these medical issues, the decision to start treatment  will also depend on your willingness to take your medications every  day and to follow the strict instructions provided by your doctor.  According to Federal Government HIV treatment guidelines: Ã¢â‚¬Å“In  general, treatment should be offered to individuals with fewer than  350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV RNA levels exceeding 55,000 copies/mL  (by RT-PCR or bDNA assay). Ã¢â‚¬Å“  </p><h3>Is it better to start therapy early or wait until my T-cell count drops?</h3><p> We now know that HIV can not be cured, or ""eradicated,"" using the anti-HIV  drugs that are currently available. However, we do know that therapy  should be started Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and continued Ã¢â‚¬â€œ before HIV has had  a chance to cause serious damage to the immune system. In this sense,  it is always best to start therapy before symptoms of AIDS occur. </p><p>There is still some debate though on just how early treatment should  start. Some experts think patients should ""hit hard and hit early,""  while other experts think that ""rushing is ridiculous.""  Here is a brief listing of the arguments each school of thought puts  forward:</p>",MedicationsViral load count,"It doesn't mean that there is no virus present,  but that the amount is so low that the particular test used cannot  measure it. As HIV disease progresses, the viral load count tends  to rise, so that someone who starts with a very low viral load count  (say 5,000 copies of virus per drop) may rise to a very high viral  load count (say, several hundred thousand or even more than a million  copies of virus per drop of blood). <p>&nbsp;</p><p>A low viral load count is good,  and a high viral load count is bad. People with new HIV infection  (called ""primary or acute"" HIV infection) also often have  very high viral load test, 100,000 or more particles per drop of blood.  This happens because in these persons the body hadn't had time to  develop antibodies which generally reduce virus levels somewhat. </p><p>Most doctors will order a routine set of blood tests every three or four months (although it may be more or less frequent depending on how far your HIV disease has progressed, what medicines you're taking, and how well you're responding to the meds). Usually the results of these blood tests come back on complicated forms that list the results of lots of different tests together. </p> <p>There are actually two types of viral load tests. A viral load report Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sent to your doctor after blood samples have been collected and sent to a lab Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will specify which test was used. Typically, labs use either the Amplicor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, or the Quantiplex branched DNA (bDNA) test. Sorry for the mouth full Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you really don't need to remember these long names. Just look for ""PCR"" or ""bDNA"" on your lab results, and you'll know which one was used.</p> <p>Each test uses a different technique to measure the amount of virus, but their results tell you the same thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the amount of HIV in your blood. It's important to use just one of these tests over time, and not switch between the two. Branched DNA values are approximately twice those measured by PCR (i.e., 10,000 copies using PCR is equal to 20,000 copies using bDNA).</p> <p>There is no ""normal"" amount of HIV, since it is not normally present in the body. Your viral load lab report will list the amount of virus that the particular test detects. For example, the first version of Amplicor PCR cannot accurately detect less than 400 copies of the virus in a drop of blood. If HIV can be detected, the results of the lab report will include the number of HIV copies found (e.g., 10,000 copies/mL [drop]). The second version of Amplicor PCR is more sensitive, but still cannot accurately detect less than 50 copies of the virus in your blood.</p> <p>If you have not yet started therapy, chances are your doctor will use the first versions of either PCR or bDNA to measure the amount of virus in your blood. This is because the first generation tests are better at measuring high levels of virus. Once you've started therapy, your doctor may use the second ""ultrasensitive"" version of either test. Again, this is because the ultrasensitive tests are better at detecting low amounts of virus in the blood.</p> <p>While taking therapy, your viral load lab report might show that HIV can no longer be detected. This is known as having an ""undetectable"" viral load in the blood. However, this does not mean that HIV is no longer present in your body or even in the blood. Studies have shown that less than 5% of HIV in the body is actually in the blood. </p><p>It is also important to keep in mind that even the newest versions of PCR and bDNA cannot detect very small amounts of HIV that may be present in the blood. (It has also been shown that even with undetectable levels of virus in the blood, the levels of virus in some body fluids such as semen and vaginal fluids, especially in the presence of infection, may be very high indeed.) But, to figure out how to treat HIV based on these results, the goal is simple: to keep the amount of HIV in your blood as low as possible.</p><h3>Understanding your viral load test</h3> Simply put, a viral load test measures the amount of HIV in your blood. It has become one of the most important tools for doctors and patients seeking to make treatment decisions. When used in combination with T-cell count results, viral load is extremely useful in determining when to begin and change anti-HIV therapy. <br />",HIV POZ 101Different drug classes,"<p>Protease inhibitors prevent T-cells that have been infected with HIV from producing new copies of the virus. When HIV infects a cell in a person's body, it copies it's own genetic code into the cell's DNA. In this way, the cell is then ""programmed"" to create new copies of HIV. Once HIV's genetic material (RNA) is inside a T-cell's nucleus, the cell produces a long strand of genetic material based on the HIV code that must be cut up and put together correctly to form new copies of the virus. Cutting up this strand requires a scissor-like enzyme called protease. PIs block this enzyme and prevent the cell from producing new viruses.</p><h3>What are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)?</h3><p>NRTIs are a class of anti-HIV drugs. When NRTIs are used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ usually a total of 3 drugs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then this combination therapy can often block the replication of HIV in a person's blood. The first 10 NRTIs listed above are currently approved by the FDA for use in these combination therapies.<br />NRTIs, sometimes referred to as ""Nucleoside Analogues"" Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or ""nukes"" for short Ã¢â‚¬â€œ prevent healthy T-cells in the body from becoming infected with HIV.</p><p>When HIV infects a cell in a person's body, it copies it's own genetic code into the cell's DNA. In this way, the cell is then ""programmed"" to create new copies of HIV. HIV's genetic material is in the form of RNA. In order for it to infect T-cells, it must first convert its RNA into DNA. HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme is needed to perform this process.<br />NRTIs contain faulty versions of the building blocks (nucleotides) used by reverse transcriptase to convert RNA to DNA. When reverse transcriptase uses these faulty building blocks, the new DNA cannot be built correctly. In turn, HIV's genetic material cannot be incorporated into the healthy genetic material of the cell and prevents the cell from producing new virus.<br /><br />While nucleotide analogues (Viread is the only nucleotide analogue approved at this time) are technically different than nucleoside analogues, they act very much the same way. In order for nucleoside analogues to work, they must undergo chemical changes (phosphorylation) to become active in the body. Nucleotide analogues bypass this step, given that they are already chemically activated.</p><h3>What are non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)?</h3><p>NNRTIs are a class of anti-HIV drugs. When one NNRTI is used in combination with other anti-HIV drugs - usually a total of 3 drugs - then this combination therapy can block the replication of HIV in a person's blood. The first 3 NNRTIs listed above are currently approved by the FDA for use in these combination therapies. NNRTIs, sometimes referred to as ""Non-Nucleoside Analogues"" - or ""non-nukes"" for short - prevent healthy T-cells in the body from becoming infected with HIV.

HIV's genetic material is in the form of RNA. In order for it to infect T-cells, it must first convert its RNA into DNA. HIV's reverse transcriptase enzyme is needed to perform this process. NNRTIs attach themselves to reverse transcriptase and prevent the enzyme from converting RNA to DNA. In turn, HIV's genetic material cannot be incorporated into the healthy genetic material of the cell, and prevents the cell from producing new virus.</p><h3>What are immune-based therpies?</h3><p>AIDS researchers have primarily concentrated on finding drugs that prevent HIV from replicating (creating more virus) inside the body. These drugs are often referred to as ""antivirals"". More recently, many researchers have been trying to find ways to help a person's immune system fight the virus on its own. Called ""immune-based therapies"", some of these treatments are now being studied in large clinical trials.</p><p>One approach is to reproduce important proteins, called ""cytokines"", that help regulate a person's immune system, then use them to stimulate or inhibit the growth and activity of various immune cells. The most tested treatment using this approach is ProleukinÃ‚Â®, a high-tech recreation of Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a naturally occurring cytokine that stimulates the production of T4-cells.</p><p>nother approach is the use of ""therapeutic vaccines"". While traditional vaccines are used to ""prime"" a person's immune system before a possible infection occurs, therapeutic vaccines attempt to ""teach"" a person's immune system to fight a virus long after it has infected them. The leading candidate for this kind of therapy is RemuneÃ‚Â®, also known as the Salk vaccine.<br />While these and other immune-based therapies are being intensively researched, it is important to note that no studies of these forms of treatment have yet been completed that have proven a clinical benefit (the ability to prolong a person's life).<br /></p>",MedicationsBlood tests you'll need ,"In addition to common blood tests like a Complete Blood Count (CBC), and a Chem-Screen (CS), you will need to do two more tests that help measure the progression of HIV disease:  <p>&nbsp;</p><ul style=""list-style-type: disc; list-style-image: url('images/stories/ulArrow.gif'); list-style-position: outside"">  <li><a class=""slink"" onclick=""javascript: openWindow('9_28_3_a','400','400','tcell',20); return false;"">T-cell count</a></li> <li><a class=""slink"" onclick=""javascript: openWindow('9_28_3_b','400','400','tcell',40); return false;"">Viral load count</a></li>  </ul>",MedicationsT-cell count,"The two main types of lymphocytes are B-cells and T-cells. B-cells  are created and mature in your bone marrow (B for bone), while T-cells  are created in bone marrow, but mature in your thymus gland (T for  thymus). B-cells produce antibodies. Antibodies help the body destroy  abnormal cells and infective organisms such as bacteria, viruses,  and fungi. T-cells are divided into three groups: <p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Helper T-Cells (also called T4 or CD4+ cells) help other cells  destroy infective organisms and orchestrate immune responses to many  infections.  </p><p>2) Suppressor T-Cells (also called T8 or CD8+ cells) suppress the  activity of other lymphocytes so they don't destroy normal tissue. </p><p>3) Killer T-Cells (also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs, and  are another kind of T8 or CD8+ cell) recognize and destroy abnormal  or infected cells.  </p><h3>What is a T4 cell count?</h3><p> T4 cells. CD4+ cells. T-helper cells. No matter what you call them, these cells  are important to know about if you are HIV-positive. (Note: whenever  we generically refer to ""T cells"" on other pages of this  web site, we are specifically referring to T4 cells). Knowing how  many T4 cells you have Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is determined by blood tests  ordered by your doctor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can tell you how healthy your immune  system is and how well it is holding up in the fight against HIV.</p><p>  Your T4 cell count will also be helpful in figuring out when to start  anti-HIV therapy and whether or not you should start taking medications  to prevent AIDS-related infections. T4 cells are responsible for signaling other immune system cells to  fight an infection in the body. They are also the prime target of  HIV, which can cause the number of these cells to decrease over time.  Too few T4 cells means that the immune system will no longer functions  like it is supposed to. </p><p>The normal T4 count is somewhere between 500 and 1500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (a drop, more or less). In the absence of anti-HIV treatment, the T4 cell count decreases, on average, about 50 to 100 cells each year. But this is an average across many persons with HIV infection. Some people loose T4 cells more rapidly and can progress to AIDS in months, while others lose T4 cells much more slowly and may do well without anti-HIV meds for a many years without progressing to AIDS. AIDS-related diseases (opportunistic infections) such as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) most often occur if your T4 count falls below 200. </p><p>And a large number of other infections can occur if it drops below 50 to 100 cells. Because of this, drugs to prevent these infections (prophylactic treatment) are started once the T4 cell count falls below certain levels, such as 200 in the case of PCP. Used in combination with viral load testing, your T4 cell count will also help you figure out when to start anti-HIV therapies. Most experts now agree that anti-HIV therapy should be started when the T4 count is 350 or lower. There is considerable debate about whether to start therapy before then and some HIV experts have suggested waiting until the count is even lower, perhaps 200.  </p><h3>What is The T4 percentage? </h3><p>If you look at your lab report, you will also see something called your CD4+ percentage  (%). This is an important number for you and your doctor to know.  In healthy adults, the number of T4 cells make up between 32% and  68% of the total number of lymphocytes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a large group of white  blood cells that include T4 cells, T8 cells (see below), and B-cells.  In fact, the lab uses the T4 percentage to determine the number of  T4 cells in a sample of blood. </p><p>The T4 percentage is sometimes a more reliable measurement than the  T4 count because it tends to vary less between measurements. For example,  one person's T4 count may vary between 200 and 300 over a several  month period while their T4 percentage remains constant at, say, 21%.  Provided that the T4 percentage stays at 21% or higher, the immune  system still generally functions properly, regardless of what the  T4 count is. </p><p>At the same time, a T4 percentage at or below 13% Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  regardless of what the actual T4 count is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ usually means that  the immune system is heavily damaged and that it is time to begin  prophylactic treatment (drugs to prevent diseases) for opportunistic  infections like PCP.  <br />  </p><h3>What is a T8 cell count, and The T-cell ratio?</h3><p>  T8 cells, also called CD8+ or Suppressor cells, play a major role in fighting  infections such as HIV. A healthy adult usually has between 150 and  1,000 T8 cells per cubic millimeter of blood. Unlike T4 cells, people  living with HIV tend to have higher-than-average T8 cell counts. Unfortunately,  nobody fully understands the reasons for this. Therefore, this test  result is rarely used in making treatment decisions. </p><p>Lab reports may also list the T-cell (CD4+/CD8+) ratio, which is the  number of T4 cells divided by the number of T8 cells. Since the T4  count is usually lower than normal in people living with HIV, and  the T8 count is usually higher, the ratio is usually lower in persons  with HIV. A normal ratio is usually between 0.9 and 6.0. Like the  T8 cell count, nobody really knows what this low number means. However,  most experts agree that once anti-HIV therapy is started, an increase  in the T-cell ratio (i.e. a rising T4 count and a falling T8 count)  is a telltale sign that drug treatment is working.</p>",HIV POZ 101Drug use and HIV Medications," Or your HIV medications can make you have a bad trip on some drugs.  Even worse, some HIV medications can increase the level of drugs or alcohol in your blood so much that you could overdose. That is why it is important to seek a doctor that you can discuss the matter with honestly and openly. <p>Ask your doctor if he or she is aware of drug interactions with the recreational drugs and your HIV medications, and what doses you should be taking to ensure your safety. Here are some steps you can take to reduce the risk of having a bad drug interaction: </p><ul> <li>Talk to your doctor or a pharmacist about the drugs you take, including methadone. He or she should be able to give you information about any potential drug interactions. Your doctor may recommend changing your HIV treatment to avoid problems.</li> <li>Consider switching to recreational drugs that appear to be safe with HIV treatments, such as marijuana.</li> <li>If you use drugs after you begin HIV treatment, start slowly. Just half of your usual hit may have the same effect that the full hit used to have.  Take a smaller dose of your drug. Wait to see how you feel and how it affects you. Take more only if you need it.</li> <li>Some HIV medications decrease the strength of methadone, which means you could go into methadone withdrawal.  Check whether your methadone dose needs to be adjusted. </li> </ul> Though not much is known about how HIV medications interact with drugs, alcohol or methadone, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist about what is known so you can stay as healthy as possible. Also, talk with other people with HIV who use drugs about their experiences and carefully monitor your own.<h3>Medications and Drugs<br /></h3><p> It is very important to take every dose of anti-HIV medications. People who are not adherent (people who miss doses) are more likely to have higher levels of HIV in their blood, and to develop resistance to their medications. Drug use is linked with poor adherence, which can lead to treatment failure. Some street drugs interact with medications. </p><p>The liver breaks down some medications used to fight HIV, especially the protease inhibitors and the non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It also breaks down some recreational drugs, including alcohol. When drugs and medications are both ""in line"" to use the liver, they might be processed much more slowly. </p><p>This can lead to a serious overdose of the medication or of the recreational drug. An overdose of a medication can cause serious problems. An overdose of a recreational drug can be deadly. Particularly deadly may be mixing a protease inhibitor with the recreational drug, Ecstasy.</p>",HIV POZ 101What is a Viral Load?," If only a small amount of virus is present (say, less than 50-200 copies depending on the test), then the test may not be able to detect the virus.

It doesn't mean that there is no virus present, but that the amount is so low that the particular test used cannot measure it. <p>As HIV disease progresses, the viral load count tends to rise, so that someone who starts with a very low viral load count (say 5,000 copies of virus per drop) may rise to a very high viral load count (say, several hundred thousand or even more than a million copies of virus per drop of blood). </p><p>A low viral load count is good, and a high viral load count is bad.

Anyone using drugs is less likely to remember about using protection, or to care about it.  Substance use and abuse is inherently dangerous, regardless of sexual orientation and practice. It can negatively affect physical health and compromise personal well-being. Drug use, itself, is considered a significant risk factor for the transmission of STDs, though it is not always regarded as such. Awareness to the effects of party drugs is necessary to reducing the prevalence of these diseases, which can cause lifelong effects and death.<br /> </p><h3>Lifestyle factors</h3> Lifestyle factors common to many gay men may exacerbate the inherently dangerous use of street drugs. For example, bars are prominent in the social landscape of many LGBT communities, and alcohol is equally common at circuit parties. Mixing party drugs with alcohol can not only cast aside discretion, it can be deadly. Furthermore, while drugs like ""poppers"" increase heart rate and relax muscles, they also dilate blood vessels and cause the heart to pump blood vigorously. When used prior to anal sex (as they often are) they increase the risk for anal bleeding and STDs if an anal tear or sore is present.  The following is a list of primary and secondary risk factors associated with drug use:  <ul> <li>Abundance of dangerous homemade synthetics on the street (made from paint thinner, cyanide, etc.) </li> <li>Dependency (need for more in light of the withdrawal effects of many party drugs, which include lethargy and depression) </li> <li>Heart attack, stroke, respiratory failure (dangerous effects of drugs combined with the rigors of physical exertion and sex) </li> <li>Heat stroke, exhaustion, severe dehydration (with dancing, especially in venues with inadequate climate control) </li> <li>Hepatitis and other STDs (through unsafe sex and sharing contaminated needles) </li> <li>HIV and AIDS (through unsafe sex and sharing contaminated needles) </li> <li>Incarceration (illegal possession of controlled substances) </li> <li>Increased risk for anal bleeding </li> <li>Long-term neurotoxicity (permanent nerve damage, mental illnesses) </li> <li>Unconsciousness, seizures, death (resulting from mixing drugs or mixing drugs and alcohol) </li> </ul><h3>Physiologically </h3><p>These drugs may cause cardiovascular, nervous system, and respiratory distress.</p><h3>Drug interactions</h3> Some street drugs interact with medications. The liver breaks down some medications used to fight HIV, especially the protease inhibitors and the non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It also breaks down some recreational drugs, including alcohol. When drugs and medications are both ""in line"" to use the liver, they might both be processed much more slowly. This can lead to a serious overdose of the medication or of the recreational drug.  An overdose of a medication can cause serious side effects. An overdose of a recreational drug can be deadly. At least one death of a person with HIV has been blamed on mixing a protease inhibitor with the recreational drug Ecstasy.  <h3>Crystal and sex</h3> There is definite connection between the use of crystal and an increased chance of contracting HIV or an STD. The raven study conducted by Public Health of Seattle and King County in 2001 have shown that almost 47% of gay and bisexual guys who inject crystal are HIV positive. The potential for getting HIV or an STD is less related to sharing needles, works, and cookers, and more related to having unprotected anal sex. <br /> <h3>Ecstasy and sex</h3> A study of 169 men at three predominantly gay nightclubs in New York City indicates a link between the club drug ecstasy and unsafe sex. According to the study in the American Journal of Psychiatry, roughly one-third of the men said they used ecstasy at least once a month, and these individuals were much more likely to have unprotected anal sex than other men. Dr. Robert L. Klitzman, the study's lead author, suggests that the drug--which produces feelings of happiness and closeness--may cause people to take greater sexual risks, or the men who take it may be natural risk-takers. The authors note that more than 50 percent of the men who discussed their sex lives said they had had unprotected anal sex at least once in the past 12 months. <br /> <h3>Injection drug use and sex</h3><p> Half of all new infections with HIV now occur among injecting drug users (IDUs), according to a review of 1996 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Sharing needles with an infected person or injecting any substance with an unsterile needle is probably the most direct way to become infected. (Sex partners of people who shoot drugs are also at greater risk if they have unprotected sex.) IV drug users should never share needles, works or cookers.  Sharing equipment also spreads <a class=""slink"" onclick=""javascript: openWindow('9_6_8','400','400','hepB',20); return false;"">hepatitis B</a> and <a class=""slink"" onclick=""javascript: openWindow('9_6_14','400','400','hepC',20); return false;"">hepatitis C</a>, and other serious diseases. </p><p>Drug users should be advised that stopping all drug use, including drug injection, is the most effective way to reduce their risks for contracting HIV/AIDS and other blood-borne diseases, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C. However, not every drug user is ready to stop using drugs, and many of those who stop may relapse.  A variety of HIV/AIDS prevention strategies to protect against becoming infected are available for individuals who may be considering or already injecting drugs. These are described in a hierarchy of HIV/AIDS risk-reduction messages, beginning with the most effective behavioral changes that drug users can make: </p><ul> <li>Stop using and injecting drugs. </li><li>Enter and complete drug abuse treatment, including relapse prevention. </li>  <li>If you continue to inject drugs, take the following steps to reduce personal and public health risks: <ul> <li>Never re-use or ""share"" syringes, water, or drug preparation equipment. </li> <li>Use only sterile syringes obtained from a reliable source (e.g., a pharmacy or a syringe access program). </li> <li>Always use a new, sterile syringe to prepare and inject drugs. </li> <li>If possible, use sterile water to prepare drugs; otherwise use clean water from a reliable source (e.g., fresh tap water). </li> <li>Always use a new or disinfected container (""cooker"") and a new filter (""cotton"") to prepare drugs. </li> <li>Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab before injecting drugs. </li> <li>Safely dispose of syringes after one use. </li> </ul></li>  </ul><p> As the hierarchy shows, drug injectors can best reduce their risks by stopping all drug use. If they inject drugs, they should always use sterile supplies and never share them. When this is not possible, cleaning and disinfecting techniques should be considered. Full-strength bleach is the most effective disinfectant when safer options are not available. </p><p>However, sterile, unused injection equipment is safer than previously used injection equipment disinfected with bleach (1). Drug users should never share their other injection equipment, such as cookers, cottons, rinse water, and drug solutions prepared for injection. Sharing these materials presents an important but often overlooked HIV transmission risk.  <br /> </p><h3>Guidelines for sex with drugs</h3> So how should we plan for our next sex with drugs experience? With a guide... and be guided by these simple guidelines: <ol> <li>Learn what triggers you to have unsafe sex. When do you party? Is it when you are depressed? Drunk? Tweaked? Identifying your triggers might help you come up with strategies that can help keep you sexually safer.</li> <li>Talk with your friends about the sex you are having. Then create a sexual safety plan and have your friend(s) help you stick to your plan. </li> <li>Bring up the topic of  STD and HIV with your sexual partner (s) and try to disclose your own HIV/STD status before you engage in sex.</li> <li>It is best if you get vaccinated for hepatitis A & B.</li> <li>Try to reduce the number of partners you have sex with.</li> <li>Ask your partner(s) what they are into sexually and establish each others' sexual boundaries before you are involved in the heat of the moment.</li> <li>If you make a mistake and do something unsafe, don't get down on yourself. Spend some time thinking what occurred, or what was different those times and try to resolve how you will avoid the situation the next time.</li> <li>Always have condoms and lube within easy access.</li> </ol>",Info and TreatmentAm I using too much?,"<p>But how do you know if you've crossed the line? Unfortunately, there is no easy answer because everyone's ""line"" is different. <br /> For example, getting high every weekend may be OK for you, but way too much for someone else. Some guys can use for months without any problems. Others seem to plunge into chaos within two weeks.</p><h3>Too much</h3> So how can you tell if you're using too much?  First of all, ""too much"" can mean several things - the amount you use, how often you use, or what happens when you use. In each case, you probably have an idea of what feels ""in control"" or ""acceptable"" to you.  Some guys set ""personal rules"" or limits to their use. Going beyond these limits could have negative results that just aren't worth the price - health problems, guilt, relationship stress, etc<h3>Your use and the rest of your life.</h3><p> When it comes to drug use, there is no free party. You have to pay somehow. That price might be a one-day crash, less spending money, or feeling bad about the sex you had the night before. It's important to see how your use impacts other parts of your life. How willing are you to accept these consequences? Is it OK that your electric bill didn't get paid last month? Is it OK that you missed your appointment with your case manager?</p><h3>Is Drug use affecting your Ã¢â‚¬Â¦</h3><p>Take a moment to think about how your drug use is affecting your:</p><ul><li>Finances : Are your bills paid? Do you have money for food?</li><li>Physical health : Do you have abscesses? Are you forgetting your HIV meds?</li><li>Mental health : Is your paranoia getting worse? How do you feel about yourself?</li><li>Personal relationships : Are you losing friends or having more arguments?</li><li>Job/school : Are you missing work, showing up late or not performing well?</li><li>Legal problems : Have you been arrested? Are you skipping P.O. appointments to avoid drug tests?</li><li>Sexual risk taking : Are you fucking without condoms or feeling shame about your sexual behavior?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Taking control of your drug use</h3><p>Here are some simple steps to keep your use in check.</p><ul><li>Tell your regular using friends what your limits are, preferably before you get high</li><li>Stay firm to your goal, even if they make jokes or try to ""tempt"" you otherwise Establish a ""purchase limit"" with your dealer. Yes, some dealers WILL do this to keep you a stable and sane customer!</li><li>Plan ""drug-free"" weekends. Schedule a lot of activities ahead of time so you don't get bored. Make commitments or ""dates"" with other people so you are less likely to change your mind and get high</li><li>Have a plan for your money. Pocket money or handy cash can really be a challenge. Spend your money on other things as soon as you get paid or put it in the bank</li><li>Ask others what they think about your use. Your friends, using buddies - even your dealer - can sometimes see you more honestly than you can. Their feedback can really be eye-opening! </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>If you're in trouble</h3><p>And finally, if you're in trouble - ask for help!!!!! Non-using friends, your case manager, family members, or others might be able to offer support.  </p><h1 id=""three""><br /> </h1>",Things to ConsiderTreatment Types ,"<p>The strictness of this guideline varies from program to program. In treatment, you may also learn new skills and strategies to handle cravings and prevent relapse. There are different levels of treatment depending on the intensity of your needs:</p><h3>DETOX</h3> 2-5 day stay in a medical facility where you can crash, come down or withdraw safely. The stay only takes care of your immediate physical needs and does not address the real ""issues"" underneath your use.<br /><h3>OUTPATIENT</h3><p> Attendance in a structured program of group and individual counseling. Designed for those who have already completed more intensive treatment or who don't need as much assistance to quit. Patients attend day or evening sessions, but still live at home or even continue working. </p><h3>INPATIENT </h3><p>Usually a 21, 28, or 90 day stay in a facility where you remain 24 hours a day. Great for people who need lots of structure and a safe environment away from triggers and access to drugs. Many programs also address mental health issues at the same time. Program components, costs, space availability, and treatment philosophy vary greatly between agencies, so shop around.  </p>",Info and TreatmentDo I have a problem?,"<p>Other terms used to describe drug use associated with negative consequences include ""misuse"", ""dependence"" and ""addiction"". As well as being used informally to describe the negative consequences of drug use, the terms ""abuse"" and ""dependence"" are also used by professionals in classifying substance-related disorders, e.g., drug dependence, alcohol abuse.  </p><p>""Drug or substance misuse"" is generally used to describe drug problems that are less serious or longstanding or, in some cases, inadvertent, such as not complying with prescription medication  instructions. When used informally, ""dependence"" refers to a situation in which a person who uses drugs feelsunable to function without taking the drug. Dependence may be either psychological or physical or both. Dependence includes continued use of the drug despite adverse consequences and usually, but not always, the presence of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms.</p><p>  Although the term ""addiction"" is no longer used as a medical diagnosis, it is still commonly used to describe a range of compulsive behaviors, including drug abuse and gambling problems. It is alsooften used to describe specialized services (as well as related policies and activities) for people with drug abuse problems.  Drug abuse can result in increased risk of health problems such as illness, injuries and physical damage tothe body or death. </p><p>Drug abuse can result in personal problems such as loss of motivation, or physicaland/or psychological dependence, and problems at work or school.  Drug abuse can result in family problems like strained and unhappy family relationships and family breakdown.  Drug abuse can contribute to social problems like increased crime and traffic crashes. Drug abuse can also result in financial costs to society for things like health care, crime or lost productivity. Sometimes even the use of a drug for medicinal purposes can cause problems. These problems may occur because of side effects from the medication, or because the drug is used for too long, at the wrong dosage or because the person does not use it as directed.</p><h3>Different types of drug problems</h3> Drug problems can develop for a variety of reasons and from use of any type of drug. <br />  <h3>Using drugs too much</h3> Use of a drug can cause a problem if too much of the drug is taken at one time or if the drug is taken too frequently. .  These problems may include immediate consequences such as unpleasant side effects or even a harmful or fatal overdose. Other problems may take some time to develop, such as needing more of the drug toachieve the same effect and becoming dependent on the drug.  Some medicinal drugs can have a beneficial effect if taken at the correct dose for that person, but can cause problems if too large a dose of the drug is taken or if the drug is used more frequently than prescribed. In the same way, a drug like alcohol may not be harmful if taken in moderation. Many of the problems caused by alcohol result from drinking too much at one time .<h3>Using drugs for too long</h3> A drug can cause problems if it is taken regularly for a long period of time. Some medicinal drugs, like pain killers, as well as drugs taken to aid sleep or reduce anxiety, can cause problems if they are taken afterthey are no longer needed. For instance, people who use drugs may have difficulty stopping use of the drug because they have become dependent on it. <br /> <h3>Taking drugs for the wrong reasons</h3> A drug can cause problems if it is taken for the wrong reason. A common example is using alcohol as a way of coping with unpleasant feelings, rather than drinking as part of a social or celebratory occasion.<h3>Taking drugs without following directions</h3> Taking drugs without paying attention to label directions and warnings can also lead to serious problems, especially with drugs that can impair driving performance and drugs that should not be mixed with alcohol. Also, taking less than the prescribeddose of a drug or stopping its use too early can result in problems.  Taking a drug prescribed for someone else is another example of not following directions, as a prescription label designates that the prescription is for a particular individual.  <br /> <h3>Combining drugs</h3> A drug can cause problems if it is taken in combination-either knowingly or unknowingly- with certain other drugs. Some combinations can produce unwanted and unexpected effects. Using alcohol with abenzodiazepine increases the likelihood that the person who uses the drugs may feel increased effects such as drowsiness, dizziness and confusion. Other combinations, like barbiturates with alcohol, can cause death.<h3>Extremely dangerous drugs</h3> With a few drugs, like PCP (Angel Dust), and inhalants such as gasoline, the potential dangers are extremely high and there are no legitimate human uses. These drugs can cause serious problems no matter how or when they are taken. With such drugs there is no difference between use and abuse. To use them is to abuse them. <br /> <h3>Commonly used and abused drugs</h3><p> Caffeine is the most commonly used psychoactive drug in our society. However, alcohol and tobacco are the most widely abused drugs by both young people and adults. Abuse of these two drugs results inenormous costs to both the individual person who uses drugs and society. Among smokers, those who begin smoking as adolescents often become regular, lifelong smokers. Smoking and heavydrinking are major causes of health problems and premature death among Americans, and they result in enormous costs to both the individual and society.  </p><p>Illegal use of drugs is more common among adolescents and young adults than other agegroups. Several surveys have found that as many youth report using cannabis in the past year as tobacco. In contrast, use of medication to aid sleep or reduce anxiety is more common among seniors than other agegroups.</p>",Things to ConsiderHarmful Consequences,"<p>But remember, some of these drugs may produce unpleasant side effects even when used under medical guidance. Drugs obtained illegally are more likely to be hazardous; their effects are much less predictable. Many drugs are harmful when used in large doses, or in combination with other drugs. <br /><br /> The specific hazards or problems of individual psychoactive drugs are listed in the charts in the second half of this section. Here we will discuss these hazards or problems in a general way and define some widely-used terms.</p><h3>Safety hazards</h3><p> Most psychoactive drugs can reduce physical coordination, distort the senses or impair memory, attention and judgment. These effects can lead to serious safety risks, especially if the person who uses the drugs drives a vehicle or operates machinery. Many road injuries and fatalities are caused by drivers intoxicated by alcohol or some other drug or combination of drugs. </p><p>Also, effects such as reduced physical coordination and impaired judgment can lead to falls and other serious accidents. People who have taken alcohol or other drugs are often unaware of how impaired their coordination or judgment really is.</p><h3>Physical health problems</h3> All psychoactive drugs have effects other than those for which they are used, and some of these can be very damaging to physical health. Smoking marijuana or tobacco, for example, can cause lung damage. Alcohol abuse can cause liver damage. Sniffing cocaine can damage the inside of the nose. People who inject drugs by hypodermic needles can get infections such as hepatitis or HIV.<h3>Mental health problems</h3> Some drugs can cause short-term confusion, anxiety or mental disturbance (""bad trips""). In the longer term, drug abuse can result in personality disturbances, learning problems, and loss of memory, and can contribute to mental health problems. A person who uses drugs as a way of avoiding normal anxiety and sadness may be establishing a pattern of behavior that can be hard to break. Many people who use drugs in this way begin to feel that they cannot function normally without drugs. Also, experience of physical or sexual abuse is common among people with alcohol or other drug problems.<h3>Violence and crime</h3><p> Use of drugs is sometimes associated with violence and crime. Although alcohol or other drugs do not cause violence, both the victims and perpetrators of violence may be using certain drugs. Date rape is one example, where the effects of benzodiazepines or alcohol may put the victim at increased risk for such violence. </p><p>Two drugs, Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) have been associated with date rape because their effects incapacitate the victim and make the person unable to resist the sexual assault. Because they are colorless, odorless and tasteless, the victim may not be aware that the drug has been deliberately added to their drink. People may also commit crimes in order to make money to buy drugs, and drug problems are frequent among criminal offenders.</p><h3>Tolerance</h3><p> Tolerance means that, over time and with regular use, a person who uses drugs needs more and more of a drug to get the same effect. Tolerance increases the physical health risks of any drug simply because it can result in increased drug use over time. Tolerance also increases the risk of dangerous or fatal overdose, for two reasons.  First, the body does not necessarily develop tolerance to all the effects of the drug to the same extent. </p><p>Long-term use of barbiturates, for example, causes a person to become tolerant to the mood-altering effect of barbiturates, but less so to their depressant effect on respiration. When this happens, the dose required to achieve the mood-altering effect may be dangerously close to the lethal dose, and death can result from respiratory failure.  </p><p>Second, if a person has not taken the drug in a long time, the expected tolerance may actually have decreased. So, after a long period of abstinence, the size of the dose the person had previously become accustomed to may actually be enough to cause a life threatening or fatal overdose.  As people age, physiological changes may mean they need less of a drug to get the same effect. This result may be compounded if their liver or kidneys have been damaged by chronic disease.</p><h3>Physical dependence</h3><p> Physical dependence occurs when a person's body becomes so accustomed to a particular drug that it can only function normally if the drug is present. If people who use drugs drastically reduce their level of use or stop using the drug abruptly, they may experience a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to seizures. </p><p>These effects, some of which can be fatal, are collectively referred to as ""withdrawal"". Withdrawal symptoms are often opposite to the effects produced by taking the drug, e.g. when a person stops using a stimulant drug such as cocaine they may become depressed, need to sleep a lot, and have increased appetite when they awaken. To avoid the discomfort of withdrawal, the person who uses drugs may start to use again or feel unable to stop using the drug. Not all drugs produce physical dependence, but they may still be abused because the person who uses drugs becomes psychologically dependent on the drug's effects.</p><h3>Psychological dependence</h3> Psychological dependence exists when a drug is so central to a person's thoughts, emotions and activities that it is extremely difficult to stop using it, or even stop thinking about it. A strong desire or craving to use a drug may be triggered by internal or external cues such as the end of a meal for smokers or seeing injection equipment for people who inject drugs. Like physical dependence, psychological dependence is a cause of continued drug use. An individual may be both psychologically and physically dependent on a drug.<h3>Overdose</h3> An overdose of any drug is a dose that can cause serious and sudden physical or  mental damage. An overdose may or may not be fatal, depending on the  drug and the amount taken. Dangerous overdoses are more likely to  occur in people who have developed a tolerance for some effects of  a drug more than others, those who return to drug use after a long  period of abstinence, or those who use drugs illegally and have no  way of knowing the exact potency of what they are buying. Sudden increases  in the purity of some illegal drugs (e.g., heroin), have resulted  in unintentional fatal overdoses. Mixing drugs such as heroin, pills  and alcohol is the most common cause of death by overdose. Drugs taken  together can interact in ways that increase their effects.<h3>Hazards of using drugs illegally</h3> Using drugs illegally has its own set of risks. People who use drugs that have been obtained illegally can never know exactly what they are taking. Dealers may not know (or reveal) exactly what they are selling. Some drugs are laced with other drugs or chemicals, or contaminated by fungi or moulds, that can be harmful. Often one drug is sold in place of another, e.g., PCP sold as LSD. As a result, many bad drug reactions, including fatal overdoses, have occurred. People who use drugs heavily may use any drug that is available at the right price.  As well, people who regularly use drugs illegally, particularly people who inject drugs, are at increased risk for a range of health, legal and social problems.<h3>Combining drugs</h3><p> Many drugs become more dangerous when they are mixed. People may combine drugs intentionally to enhance the effects, or to counteract undesirable side-effects, or they may use a hazardous combination of drugs without intending to do so. For example, they may take sleeping medications after drinking alcohol without being aware that using these drugs together is hazardous. Even if the person is aware that mixing drugs is dangerous, they may do so anyway.</p><p> Today a mixture of heroin and cocaine is a common example. People who use drugs illegally may mix drugs unknowingly because they do not know what they are taking.  Many drugs taken together have the potential to interact with one another to produce greater effects than either drug taken by itself. Or, the combination of drugs may produce a new or unexpected effect. For example, alcohol, opioid analgesics (like codeine), barbiturates (like Seconal</p>",Things to ConsiderWhat is a drug?,"The word ""psychoactive"" literally means working (active) on the mind or behavior (psycho).  The effects of a drug are also influenced by how it is taken and by factors such as the age and gender of the person who uses the drug.  Drug use is often described as being legal or illegal (although, for most drugs, it is the possession, manufacture, cultivation and/or sale of the drugs, which may be judged technically to be legal or illegal). <p>Most drugs used for medicinal purposes are legally available by prescription or sold over-the-counter. Drugs used for non-medicinal purposes include alcohol and tobacco, which can be purchased or used legally by almost anyone who is of legal age.  Some drugs are usually obtained illegally. </p><p>These include cannabis (marijuana, hashish [hash] and hash oil), cocaine, heroin and LSD. Such drugs are usually produced (grown or manufactured in illegal laboratories) for sale on the street. Prescription drugs are also sold and possessed illegally when the transaction does not involve the legal filling of a valid prescription (e.g., Ritalin</p>",Info and TreatmentWhy do we use drugs?," <h3>Media and communications</h3><p> Advertisements on radio or TV and in magazines or newspapers, product sponsorship of sporting and artistic events, portrayal of substance use in plays and films and availability of information on the Internet can all affect the way people think about drugs in general, including how they regard illegal drug use. </p><p>Advertisements may promote drinking or smoking as a social activity or link use to the achievement of success; magazine and TV advertisements may also promote use of over-the-counter medications as treatments for minor ailments; characters in plays or films may provide models for healthy or unhealthy substance use; the Internet provides access to information on drugs through sources ranging from government public awareness materials to ""how to"" manuals advising on the illegal use or manufacture of drugs.</p><h3>Positive reinforcement </h3> A person may use a drug and keep using a drug because the effects are pleasurable or positively  reinforcing. Examples of such pleasurable or positively reinforcing effects can include: feeling ""high"", <strong>relaxation, disinhibition, relief from pain, tension or unpleasant emotions, being able to sleep or to stay awake or achieve enhanced athletic performance or enhanced sexual pleasure.</strong>  <h3>Curiosity </h3> Drugs are talked and written about a lot these days. They are a frequent topic of conversation. Some people may have friends or acquaintances who use drugs illegally. Since curiosity is a natural aspect of human behavior, it is not surprising that many people, especially young people, are tempted to experiment with drugs, both legally and illegally.<h3>Celebration </h3> The use of drugs such as alcohol, may be part of a family occasion, cultural or religious celebration or practice.  <h3>Emotional pressures</h3>  Some people use psychoactive drugs to relieve various emotional problems, such as anger, stress, anxiety, boredom or depression. Others take psychoactive drugs to boost their self-confidence. Some young people may use drugs as a way of rebelling or to express their alienation from mainstream society. People may also use drugs to help them forget about or cope with traumatic life events or situations or to relieve the symptoms of severe psychiatric illness. <h3>Social pressures </h3><p>  The social pressures to use drugs can be very strong. Both young people and adults may feel social pressure to use drugs (e.g., alcohol on social occasions). Children may be especially influenced by their parents' use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs, and use their parent's use to justify their own drug use. </p><p>In some groups, drug-taking is the fashionable thing to do. It is the badge of belonging and the key to social acceptance. Abstainers are excluded. It is hard to be different; so people go along. Going along may mean using cannabis or drinking heavily to be part of a group in which this is the norm without regard to potential negative consequences.  Group pressures of a different kind exist for those engaged in competitive sports or body building. People may use substances, particularly anabolic steroids, because they view such drug use as an accepted part of a successful training regimen.</p><h3>Previous drug use </h3><p>  For most people, trying a drug, particularly using a drug illegally, for the first time is a major step. A single experiment does not mean a person will become a regular user of drugs, but it may remove some of the barriers against trying drugs again.  In some cases, people who regularly use one drug are more likely to use other drugs as well. For example, regular smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers than nonsmokers. </p><p>Not surprisingly, there is also a high correlation between smoking tobacco and cannabis use. Also, those who start to smoke or drink early in adolescence are more likely to develop drug problems in later life, than those who begin smoking or drinking in later adolescence.  </p><h3>Dependence  </h3>  Some people use drugs because they have become physically or psychologically dependent on them. It does not matter whether the drug is mild or strong, whether it was first used for medical or non-medical purposes, or whether it is used legally or illegally. When people continue using a certain drug because they experience discomfort or distress when use is discontinued or severely reduced, they can be said to be drug-dependent.",Things to ConsiderFacts and definitions,"  <h3>Incidence and prevalence </h3>  A 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that approximately 15,000,000 people in the United States use illicit drugs. Approximately 1% of the adult population in the United States abuses narcotics. Some evidence suggests that about 5% of adults aged 18 to 25 use or have used narcotic drugs like heroin. Other estimates put this number higher. Men in the United States use illicit drugs slightly more than women. Narcotic abuse among non-Caucasian people is reportedly highest, especially in urban areas. <br />  <h3>Addiction: How narcotics work </h3>  The biochemical effects of narcotic drugs are what make them addictive. Narcotics bind to painkilling sites throughout the brain, known as opioid-U receptors or the ""reward pathway."" This leads to slower uptake of neurotransmitters, like dopamine, between neurons. Immediate effects include cessation of pain, drowsiness, and a feeling of well-being associated with pain reduction. With chronic use, the brain may stop producing endorphins, natural painkilling chemicals, and the user develops tolerance. The user must replace the missing endorphins with narcotics in order to feel good and to avoid the painful effects of narcotic withdrawal. The user becomes dependent on increasing amounts of the drug to feel good. Abuse usually leads to dependence.  Addiction is a chronic illness of the brain. Although one initially chooses to use narcotics, addiction is more than a behavioral problem; it is physiological and psychological. Compulsive use and relapse after recovery are a few of the behavioral problems that result from dependence. Use and relapse may be enforced by environmental cues, like peer influence and specific cultural stimuli. Breaking the habit of drug addiction is difficult and requires detoxification, changes in lifestyle, and therapy.<h3>Withdrawal</h3> Withdrawal may occur 4 to 12 hours after stopping heavy and prolonged use of narcotics, depending on the drug, and may last 14 days. Physical signs include gooseflesh, muscle aches (often in the legs and back), abdominal cramping and diarrhea, and insomnia. Mentally, a person may experience depression, anxiety, panic, irritability, and craving.  <br /> <h3>Tolerance</h3> Tolerance describes the body's need for increasing amounts of a drug to get the same effects and, ultimately, to avoid withdrawal. People who have long-time addictions may take dangerously high doses that would kill first-time users.  <br /> <h3>Abuse</h3> Abuse is defined as the recreational use of a substance that results in impairment, negative consequences, and decline. Typically, those who have this type of pattern of drug use experience withdrawal less frequently than those who are dependent. However, prolonged, intermittent use of narcotics is uncommon; most people who abuse them become dependent. <h3>Dependence</h3> Dependence means that a drug user is unable to reduce dosage or stop using because the brain is chemically dependent on the drug. The most significant sign of psychological dependence is that the user plans daily activities around obtaining and using the drug. Physiological signs of dependence include withdrawal.  <h3>Overdose</h3> Overdose (OD), severe intoxication occurs when too much of the drug enters the body too quickly, usually after IV injection. Variations in the potency, quality, and dose of narcotic drugs lead to most overdoses. Severe respiratory depression and death can result from OD.<h3>Risk factors </h3>  Psychological and environmental risk factors for narcotic use include the following:  <ul> <li>Antisocial and experimental attitudes (i.e., rebellious nature) during adolescence </li> <li>Environmental factors:<ul> 	<li>Family problems </li> 	<li>Gang membership </li> 	<li>Inner-city culture </li> 	<li>Poverty </li> 	<li>Wealth or disposable income</li> 	</ul></li> 	  <li>Family history of substance abuse and drug addiction </li> <li>Low self-esteem</li> </ul><h3>Harm reduction </h3><p>A Harm Reduction model for an alcohol/substance abuse program endeavors to reduce the stereotyping, stigmatization, and shame which, when internalized, become for many the causative factors for relapse. Harm Reduction is about relapse prevention, allowing a client to continue to hold a job and become self-sufficient.  </p><p>The Harm Reduction model allows therapists to work with clients who are not yet abstinent and also with those clients who choose not to be abstinent. Strategies are developed both for those wishing to stay abstinent as well as those wishing to reduce the amount of harm due to their drug use. Specific strategies and contingency planning (what happens if...) are employed to reduce the amount of drugs/alcohol consumed and to render the client's drug experience a safer, less harmful, and more functional experience.  </p><p>These strategies are designed to be portable to the rest of the community so that family, friends, and the local community in which the user resides may also benefit from this knowledge. Family, friends and community residents should all be welcome to counseling seminars.  Persons who have alcoholism or serious substance abuse issues, whose lives have been catastrophically disrupted and have been quite literally ""kicked to the curb,"" do not need to be harangued, harassed, or attacked (as in ""attack therapy""). All forms of ""ceremonial degradation"" in which individual egos are deliberately shattered are discouraged in favor of coping strategies designed to reduce use and harm.</p>",Info and TreatmentInjection use: Use Alcohol Wipes,"<br />They stimulate the skin surface and make it shine.  Hard- to- find veins are easier to see and hit, especially if you use side lighting!  <ol> <li>Wash your hands and skin!</li> <li>Use plenty of hot, soapy water!</li> <li>Follow up with alcohol wipes!</li> </ol>  <h3>How do I use alcohol wipes?</h3><p>  Step one:<br /> Take an alcohol pad and wipe back and forth where you plan to inject. This will probably be your arm. Press kind of hard this first time. Use as many pads as you need to get the dirt off of your skin. But don't stop here! </p><p>Step two:<br /> Now grab a new pad and press down over the spot where you're going to inject. This time, wipe in a circle. Start with small circles and make bigger circles as you go around. </p><p>This pushes any leftover dirt and bacteria on your skin outward from the spot where you're going to shoot.  Note: If you bleed after you shoot, press down with dry cotton or a band-aid to stop the flow. Don't use an alcohol pad; alcohol slows down clotting.</p>",Injection Drug UseWhat are Abscesses?,"<h3>What causes abscesses</h3> An abscess can start anywhere in the body where bacteria infect tissue. Drug shooters often get abscesses on their arms or legs -- mostly (but not always) at injection sites. You are more likely to damage tissue and develop an abscess when you ""skin pop,"" ""muscle it,"" or miss your vein. Both the cut and the drug itself can cause infection and damage tissue. You can even get an abscess AFTER you stop injecting. <br /> <h3>Where do the germs come from?</h3> Germs are invisible without a microscope. They are on most surfaces, including skin, and on any used item such as a rig, cooker, cotton, or tourniquet. Germs are on your skin -- even if you think you're clean. All of these germs can get into your body.  <br /> <h3>What signs should I look for?</h3> A hard, reddish, tender lump. It will usually appear at the injection site, but it can also pop up in other places. The lump might feel warmer than the skin around it. It might even feel hot. It usually hurts. It might look pink and puffy. If it gets bigger, the infection is getting worse. As the infection spreads, you might see red streaks spreading out and away from the abscess. The infection might make you feel tired or cause fever or chills. You might have chest pains if the infection goes to your heart or lungs.<h3>What should I do if I get an abscess? </h3> It depends on how bad it is.  Here are some guidelines<br /><br />  Treat at HOME with a HOT SOAK if:<br /> You don't have any red streaks or hot puffy skin around it<br /><br /> Go to a CLINIC if:<br /> It has not improved after 5 to 7 days<br />  The lump gets bigger or more painful<br />  You see red streaks spreading out from the lump<br />  The lump is hot, puffy, and pink, or if you get a fever<br /><br /> Go to the EMERGENCY ROOM if:<br /> You have chest pains<br />  You have chills or a high fever<br />  The infection looks like it is spreading really fast <br /><h3>How do I hot soak?</h3><p> Soaking helps draw out the infection. It helps the abscess come to a head and drain</p><ul><li>Soak the abscess in a tub of plain hot water. This works well if the abscess is on your hand or lower arm</li><li>  Better yet, soak it in hot water and Epsom Salts</li><li>  Make sure the water is hot, but not so hot that it burns your skin</li><li>  Hold a hot, wet wash cloth over the abscess if the abscess is in a spot you can't easily put under water</li><li>  Soak at least 3 or 4 times a day, 10 to 15 minutes each time</li></ul><p>If you have a bad infection, you may need to take antibiotics. If your doctor prescribes antibiotics, be sure to finish them ALL -- even if you feel better before they're used up. If you don't take the whole course of antibiotics, or if you don't take them correctly, the germs they are supposed to treat can develop resistance. Resistant bacteria make antibiotics less useful against future infections. If pus is trapped under the skin, a health provider may need to open the wound to drain the pus. Antibiotics alone may not treat trapped pus. <a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a><br />  </p><h3>How can I reduce my risk for abscesses?</h3><p> Before you shoot, WASH your skin and hands with HOT, SOAPY WATER. Hot water and vigorous rubbing make the veins bigger, too. Use a BRAND NEW, STERILE RIG every time you inject or divide drugs. If you can't get a new rig, use one that is well-rinsed, bleached for at least 30 seconds, then rinsed again with fresh, clean water.  Use clean cottons, clean cookers and fresh, clean water every time. Clean the injection site properly with alcohol wipes.  Don't lick the needle before you inject. You carry a lot of bacteria in your mouth that can cause infections under your skin. </p><p>Choose good veins. Keep your veins big and fat by drinking lots of water. It is harder to miss when you have big veins. Sometimes a miss will get infected and turn into an abscess. Use a tourniquet. This increases blood pressure in the veins and makes skinnier veins bigger around, easier to see, and easier to hit. Slow down. Relax. Take a deep breath to help keep your hand steady so you don't miss. Shaky hands from a 5- day speed run or from being dope sick can cause you to miss. Avoid shooting into your hands and especially avoid feet and legs. <br /> </p><h3>Where do I shoot? Vein? Muscle? Skin? What's safer?</h3>  All three have risks. All three put you at risk for infections like HIV and Hepatitis B and C. Muscling and skin popping are more likely to cause abscesses and skin infections. If treated early, these infections usually clear up in a short period of time. Shooting into a vein is more likely to cause longer- term problems like endocarditis. Shooting into a vein is also more likely to cause an overdose. Abscesses hurt and they can cause ugly disfigurement, but they're rarely fatal. Endocarditis and overdose, on the other hand, are more likely to result in death.  <br /><br />Warnings!!!<br /> DO NOT shoot into or near an abscess. <br /> DO NOT squeeze or cut into an abscess -- you could push germs into your bloodstream. This could ""seed"" your heart lining with bacteria that can cause an infection to grow in your heart. This is called endocarditis, and it's a life-threatening condition. <br /> People with weak immune systems are more likely to develop abscesses. If you have a weak immune system, you need to be even more careful. <br />",Injection Drug UseHow to clean the injection site," Step One: Take an alcohol pad and wipe back and forth where you plan to inject. (This will probably be your arm.) You want to press kind of hard this time. Use as many pads as you need to get the dirt off your skin. But don't stop here! You're not done! That's why wipes come two to a pack.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step Two: Now grab a new pad, and press down over the spot where you're going to inject. This time, wipe in a circle. Start with small circles and make bigger circles as you go. This pushes any leftover dirt and bacteria on your skin outward from the spot where you're going to shoot. </p>",Injection Drug UseHow to reduce your risk,"But here are 8 ways to reduce your risks: <ol> <li>Always use a brand new sterile syringe every time you inject. </li> <li>Wash your hands and the injection site well. Use plenty of hot soapy water. Getting bacteria into the muscle, fat tissue or under the skin is a leading cause of abscesses. </li> <li>Use an alcohol pad to clean the injection site. See the box for directions on how to use alcohol pads. </li> <li>Use a clean cooker and fresh clean water to cook your hit. </li> <li>Filter the hit well. Use a brand new cotton every time you draw up a hit. </li> <li>Rotate injection sites. This will reduce abscess formation. It will also give your skin and muscle a chance to heal. </li> <li>Get a tetanus booster. If you inject, it is a good idea to get one every five years. You can get a booster at the downtown needle exchange medical clinic. </li> <li>Don't muscle or skin-pop speed or cocaine. It may be painful and is more likely to cause an abscess</li> </ol>",Injection Drug UseSyringe access,"<h3>Health risks </h3><p>Injecting drugs can be unsafe and dangerous to your health. If you inject without always using sterile equipment and methods, you run the risks for getting HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  Injecting drugs can also lead to serious abscesses, cellulitis, heart infections, and death from overdose. <br />  </p><h3>How to reduce your risk</h3> If you do inject, there are ways to be safer and reduce your risk of disease and infection: <ul> <li>Use a brand new, sterile syringe every time you inject or divide drugs.  Even re-using your own syringe can put you at risk for infections.</li> <li>Never share syringes, cookers, cottons, water, or water bottles with anybody.</li>  <li>Use a new alcohol pad to clean the injection site.</li> <li>Use a clean cooker and fresh, clean water to cook your hit.</li> <li>Use a brand new cotton every time you draw up a hit.</li> <li>Do not inject into the same spot over and over again.</li> <li>Do not put the tip of the needle in your mouth before injecting.</li> <li>Go to a medical clinic at the first signs of an infection.</li> </ul><h3>Protecting yourself and others </h3><p>There are two things you can do to protect yourself and others. </p><ol> <li>Learn your HIV status by getting tested. If you are not infected, you can stay that way.  If you are infected you can learn how to take care of yourself and avoid passing HIV and hepatitis on to others.</li>  <li>Learn your hepatitis status and get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B if you haven't already had the vaccine or the disease. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C</li></ol>",Injection Drug UseHow to bleach your works,"To be safe, use a brand new sterile rig every time.  Always use fresh clean water, a new cooker and fresh cotton when you prepare your hit. How to bleach your works in three easy steps: <ol> <li>Fill the syringe with water. Tap it with your finger to loosen blood drops. Shake the syringe. Shoot out the bloody water. Repeat these steps until you can't see any blood.</li>  <li>Fill the syringe with bleach. Make sure the bleach touches the inside of the syringe for at least 30 seconds. Shoot it out.</li>  <li>Rinse out the bleach with NEW CLEAN water. Shoot it out. But remember, there is no substitute for a brand new syringe.</li> </ol>",Injection Drug UseViagra ,"<p>Also known as: Sildenafil citrate<br /><br />Sildenafil citrate, better know by its brand name, Viagra, is a drug manufactured by Pfizer Labs. It helps you get and maintain an erection when you're sexually aroused. As with all prescription drugs, consult your physician before trying Viagra.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Getting an erection requires a series of biochemical reactions in your penis (your arteries dilate to allow more blood into your penis, while your veins constrict to keep blood from getting out). Viagra works by helping your arteries open wider to bring even more blood into your penis. </p><p>Viagra only helps you get an erection if you're sexually stimulated; you won't get hard just by swallowing a pill. Viagra is currently being tested for effectiveness in women with sexual dysfunction. There are many reports that it does improve sexual arousal in women, but these reports are anecdotal. Viagra must be tested on a large scale before definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p><h3>How is it used?</h3>When you're sexually excited, a dose of Viagra can help produce an erection in about 30 to 60 minutes. Your erection may last for up to four hours, depending on how large a dose you take and how quickly your body breaks down the drug. If you take Viagra after eating a meal that's high in fat, it may take longer for Viagra to start working. Viagra comes in 25, 50 and 100 milligram doses. You should consult your physician to determine which one is right for you.<br /><h3>What are the side effects?</h3><p>The most common side effects of Viagra include headache, flushing of the face, and stomachache. Less commonly, you may experience a temporary change in color vision (trouble distinguishing between blue and green, for example), your vision may blur or your eyes may become more sensitive to light. In rare cases, Viagra may cause a condition known as priapism, in which in your erection doesn't go down even after you've ejaculated. </p><p>While this may sound like a dream come true, in fact, a prolonged erection for over six hours can permanently damage your penis -- call your doctor immediately if your erection lasts more than four (ouch!). Other reported side effects include irregular heartbeat, stroke, heart attack and death. As with all medications, if you develop strange or unusual symptoms, let your doctor know immediately.</p><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3><p>A dangerous reaction can occur if you combine Viagra with drugs containing nitrates, which are often used in people with heart disease to improve blood flow through their blocked arteries. Common examples of nitrates include nitroglycerin (taken to relieve chest pain) and amyl nitrite (the club drug known as ""poppers""). </p><p>Combining Viagra and nitrates can drop your blood pressure to dangerous levels, which may result in dizziness, heart attack, stroke and death. Sex requires your heart to work harder, so if you have heart problems, consult your doctor before taking Viagra. If you maintain an erection that lasts over four hours, see your doctor immediately; a prolonged erection can cause permanent damage to your penis. When taking Viagra, consult your doctor before stopping or starting other medications. </p><p>If you take antibiotics or protease inhibitors, talk to your doctor before taking Viagra -- combining these drugs may enhance the side effects of Viagra, particularly headaches and flushing of the face, though studies are inconclusive. There have been reports of patients who've taken protease inhibitors and Viagra and have died from the drug interaction. Your doctor may recommend other treatments or a much lower dose of Viagra.</p>",LegalWhat is needle exchange?,"Nationally, over 1/2 of all new HIV infections stem from injection drug users: 2/3 of these from sharing needles, and the rest either from unprotected sex with an injection drug user or transmission from an infected mother to her fetus or newborn child.  Needle exchange programs provide new, sterile syringes in a one-for-one exchange for used contaminated syringes. But needle exchange programs are not just about syringes. <p>They also help drug users get into drug treatment and health care and provide important risk reduction information. Other services include counseling and testing for HIV infection, distribution of condoms, and safe disposal of contaminated equipment.  Seattle's program began operating in 1989. </p><h3>Why are needle exchange programs offered?</h3> Needle exchange is one of the most effective AIDS prevention programs currently available for injection drug users who are not in treatment. Without a vaccine or a cure, prevention is the only tool we have to control the spread of HIV. Public Health runs a needle exchange program for four basic reasons: <ul> <li>Needle exchange reduces blood-borne diseases in our communities without increasing drug use. Studies have shown decreases in both the number of persons who become infected with HIV and the number of people who get hepatitis in communities that have needle exchange programs. </li>  <li>Preventing HIV infection in injection drug users also prevents HIV in women and newborn children. Many women are at risk for HIV because of their own injection drug use or because they are sexual partners of injection drug users. </li>  <li>By working with injection drug users, we can help them get into drug treatment. </li>  <li>Finally, Public Health safely disposes of all contaminated syringes turned in to the exchange. This reduces the number of discarded syringes on our sidewalks and in our bus stops, yards, parks and playgrounds. Our goal is to get used syringes out of circulation as quickly as possible. The longer a syringe remains in circulation, the more opportunities there are for that syringe to pass on a blood-borne disease.</li>  </ul><h3>Are needle exchange programs successful? </h3><p>Yes. A recent study compared cities that had low rates of HIV infection among drug injectors with cities in which drug injectors had high rates of infection. The study found that each of the low rate cities had started needle exchange and prevention outreach programs early in the AIDS epidemic before AIDS could get a foothold. </p><p>Most cities that responded early in the epidemic by implementing comprehensive needle exchange programs have kept infection rates among drug injectors below 5%, while rates of infection in cities like New York and Miami (where needle exchange began late or not at all) are between 40% and 60%. Infection rates among injection drug users in Seattle have remained stable over the last seven years. Public Health estimates that 2 to 4% of local drug injectors are infected with HIV. <br /> </p><h3>Is it legal to give out syringes?</h3> Public Health doesn't give out syringes -  we <strong>EXCHANGE</strong> them. And exchanging them was ruled legal by Washington State's Supreme Court in 1992. In a case filed by Spokane County, the court held that exchange programs are an appropriate HIV prevention measure and are legally sanctioned within the broad powers given to Public Health Officers to control disease in communities.",Injection Drug UseNicotine ,"<p>I was harassed a lot in high school. I wasn't athletic... terrible on the field. The jocks never bothered the smokers -- it was like some unwritten law. So I started smoking, swapping cigarettes with them between class and I got picked on less. I went to college and fell in with smokers there too. I'm only 35 but I've been smoking for almost 20 years.</p><p>In fact, a study published in December 1999 by the American Journal of Public Health found that nearly half of all gay men smoke, rates nearly double those found among men in the general population. According to UCSF research, 48 percent of gay men reported recent cigarette use compared to 27 percent of all men in the United States. Ron Stall, who directed the University of California, San Francisco research team, wrote that current tobacco prevention efforts aimed at educating gay and bisexual men about the dangers of smoking are clearly ""failing"" to get their message across.</p><h3>What is it really?</h3>Smokers crave nicotine in tobacco, one of the most highly addictive and commonly abused substances in human history. Nicotine is a psychoactive drug, with researchers comparing its addictive pull to heroin and cocaine. Indeed, it works on the same areas of the brain as do these ""harder"" drugs. Nicotine can act as either a stimulant or a sedative. Studies show that nicotine prompts the release of dopamine, the brains pleasure chemical. Nicotine withdrawal is long and difficult. Many ex-smokers report cravings years after giving up. A study in 1986 reported that 68 percent of all smokers wanted to quit, and in that year a third of them tried seriously, but only 6 percent of all smokers succeeded. Don't despair; people who keep trying, however, have a 50 percent chance of finally succeeding.<br /><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>As with alcohol, the legal ingestion of the highly toxic and addictive agents found in tobacco has long been regarded as socially acceptable, a factor that has greatly contributed to its widespread abuse. Decades of social and cultural promotion (in Hollywood films, for example) linked smoking with wealth and sophistication and later with gangsterism, toughness, and rebellion to authority. Tobacco marketing reinforced these popular images, reaping billions in cigarette sales. </p><p>Many gay men and women embraced the cultural assumptions attached to smoking as a way to deflect attention from their otherness. As is so often the case, what began as a declarative statement in their youth turned into unbreakable addiction by adulthood. Doctors and researchers have long known that psychological factors play a major role in people's susceptibility to smoking cigarettes. Given the pressures young gay men and women face -- including depression or loneliness, fear of exposure, harassment at school or problems at home -- gay youth are at much higher risk for smoking cigarettes than are other people of their age and background. Though tobacco can also be chewed (and in bygone days, pulverized and snorted as snuff), the preferred method of ingestion worldwide is smoking cigarettes.</p><h3>Physiological impact</h3><p>There is no way to negate the impact of smoking on your health. Cigarettes kill over 430,700 people a year in the United States, making it more lethal than automobile accidents, AIDS, homicide, suicide and drug overdoses combined. Smoking is responsible for an estimated one in five deaths in the U.S. Vain? People who smoke are at higher risk for gum disease and tooth decay. They look older than nonsmokers do. </p><p>When compared to nonsmokers, smokers are nearly five times more likely to develop more and deeper wrinkles as they age. Smoking also appears to increase your risk for baldness. The American Lung Association reports that smoking is responsible for 87 percent of all cases of lung cancer and is a contributing factor in as many as 30 percent of all cancer deaths. </p><p>It is the main cause of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking and smokeless tobacco also cause between 60 and 90 percent of cancers of the throat, mouth, and esophagus. Smokers have higher rates of leukemia, cancers of the kidney, bladder and pancreas. Are we done with the problems associated with smoking? </p><p>Not quite - there's more! Smoking greatly increases the risk of heart disease. Smokers in their thirties and forties are five times more likely to suffer heart attacks than nonsmokers their age. One recent study found that only 42 percent of smokers reached the age of 73 compared to 78 percent of people who didn't smoke. Your body recovers from smoking the way it recovers from any trauma, and quitting, or even attempting to quit, brings full recovery one day closer. </p><p>Stop smoking and you can look and feel better than you have in years. Compare that to coughing, heavy lungs, yellow teeth, recurrent sinus and ear infections, shortness of breath and low energy! Numerous treatments are available to help you quit smoking, including medication, nicotine gum and patches, hypnosis, acupuncture and more. Everybody's different, so consult your doctor about which treatments might be best to help you quit. It's like the Surgeon General says: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.</p>",LegalPoppers ,"<p>Also known as: Amyl nitrite, Butyl nitrite<br /><br />Amyl and Butyl nitrites were designed to treat angina (chest pain) and not (shock of shocks) to make your head spin. Poppers are mostly sold in sex shops and gay nightclubs, and are said to enhance your sexual arousal and prolong and intensify your orgasms.</p><h3>What is it really?</h3>Technically, amyl and butyl nitrites are vasodilators - medication that increases your heart rate and expands your blood vessels, producing a brief high or ""rush"". The combined effects cause your blood pressure to drop precipitously. The rush comes as your heart struggles to keep blood flowing to your brain.<br /><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>Poppers come as a yellowish liquid in small, screw top bottles. Sniffing makes your blood pressure drop, so your brain gets less blood and you become light-headed and giddy. You may also feel a heat flash, intense sexual desire and the sensation of blood rushing to your head. These effects usually last less than a minute and not more than two. Some users complain of a headache after use. </p><p>Brand names for poppers include: Ram, Rush, Liquid Gold and Thrust (hello, sexual metaphor!). When fresh, poppers smell sweet, like citrus, but acquire an unpleasant sock odor when stale. With persistent use, poppers have been known to cause burns around the nose. Their vapor is extremely flammable, so don't smoke while you do poppers.</p><h3>Physiological impact</h3><p>Side effects of poppers include: headache, nausea, coughing, dizziness and -- less frequently -- a brief loss of consciousness. People who are anemic, have high blood pressure, blocked arteries, heart trouble or a family history of cerebral hemorrhaging should not use poppers. </p><p>Studies show that you can develop a tolerance to poppers. While there's no evidence that physical dependence follows regular use, many gay men report some aspects of psychological dependence; for example, many feel they can no longer have sex without using poppers. Medical research also shows that poppers lower your immune response to infection many hours after use. This can increase your chances of catching HIV or another STD.</p><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3>Recent deaths occurred in men who used poppers in combination with Viagra. Both drugs dilate blood vessels, and when combined, they can cause blood pressure to drop so low that your heart and brain don't get enough oxygen to function. Do not use poppers if you are on anti-depressants, heart disease or blood pressure medication or if you are anemic or suffer from glaucoma. The interactions are dangerous and can be fatal. Use of poppers with any drug or medication that lowers blood pressure is dangerous and potentially life threatening.",LegalProzac,"<p>Also known as: Fluoxetine hydrochloride<br /><br />The statistics about depression are, well, sobering. More than 18 million people in the United States alone suffer from it, two-thirds of whom don't get the help they need, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Though not as prevalent, obsessive-compulsive disorder and bulimia are two other psychological conditions that often go undiagnosed and can disrupt a person's life. In a survey conducted by GayHealth.com, it was found that depression was the number one health concern of the LGBT communities.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Your brain has billions of cells (neurons) which communicate with each other by sending chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, across bridges (synapses) that link your neurons together. Serotonin is a type of neurotransmitter that has been found to affect your sleep, mood and behavior. Prozac belongs to a group of drugs called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which keep serotonin from being reabsorbed into its storage spots in the brain. Researchers have found that boosting levels of serotonin by inhibiting its reabsorption helps alleviate symptoms of depression, OCD and bulimia.</p><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>Prozac is usually taken in pill form each morning. Like other SSRIs, it may take up to four weeks for your blood levels to rise and for you to feel the full effects of Prozac. That's why it's crucial you take it as prescribed and avoid missing doses. Consult your doctor if you want to increase your dosage or discontinue therapy. </p><p>In February 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Prozac Weekly, a once-a-week treatment for patients whose depressive symptoms have stabilized but who need continuing treatment to prevent a relapse of acute depression. If you think this treatment might be right for you, talk to your doctor. Prozac does not work for everyone. If it doesn't work for you, your doctor may want you to try other SSRIs or a different class of antidepressant. </p><p>For depression, most doctors advise an initial daily dose of 20 milligrams, though you and your doctor may consider a gradual increase after assessing the drug's effect over a trial period of several weeks. For bulimia, a daily dose of 60 milligrams is usually recommended, though studies indicate that lower doses may also be effective. For OCD, a daily dose ranging from 20 to 60 milligrams is usually recommended. </p><p>For the elderly, lower or less frequent doses of Prozac may be recommended. Your doctor may adjust your dose depending on your response to the drug. If you miss a dose, skip it and continue on your regular schedule; don't double up. Prozac comes in 10 and 20 milligram pills and a 20 milligram liquid, both of which can be taken with or without food. Avoid taking more than 80 milligrams a day. Prozac is not a drug that should be taken without a doctor's prescription or supervision. </p><p>Don't ""borrow"" a pill from a friend for a pick-me-up. In low dose, Prozac is beneficial in treatment of premature ejaculation. UPDATE: Generics now available. On August 2, 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug administration gave the go-ahead for drug companies to produce generic forms of Prozac. The generic versions are expected to reduce the cost of the drug by 25 to 40 percent or more.</p><h3>What are the side effects?</h3><p>There are several side effects that should be brought to your doctor's immediate attention: itchy rashes, trouble breathing, chest pain, anxiety, feeling agitated, a pounding heartbeat and suicidal thoughts. Other side effects that you should also discuss with your doctor include: nausea, headache, trouble sleeping, tremors, changes in taste (of food, not interior design!) and a decreased libido or impotence. Appetite and weight changes may result from treatment. Significant weight loss may occur -- especially in depressed or bulimic patients who are underweight. Inform your doctor of any side effects you develop while taking Prozac. </p><p>Impotence and loss of libido are particularly troubling side effects of the SSRI class of antidepressants -- especially since LGBT people are often reluctant to discuss sexual issues with their physicians. Many times these problems are not addressed because the doctor is unaware. Unfortunately, impotence and loss of libido are not usually dose related. This means that if you have the problem, lowering your Prozac or other SSRI dose may not improve it, and might bring on a worse depression instead. If after starting an antidepressant, you suffer from impotence or notice a falling libido, talk to your doctor. Your doctor may prescribe a different class of medication. Do not suddenly discontinue Prozac if you've been taking it for long periods; you may experience a dangerous withdrawal.</p><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3><p>Warning! Do not take Prozac within two weeks of discontinuing a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor (a type of antidepressant, which includes St. John's Wort), and do not take an MAO inhibitor within five weeks of discontinuing a chronic or high-level dosage of Prozac. An interaction of these two drugs can be fatal. </p><p>Consuming alcohol or taking blood thinners, sleeping pills, painkillers, muscle relaxers or certain cold and allergy medications can also cause a dangerous interaction when taken with Prozac. Consult your doctor before taking these or any other medications. Prozac may make you feel sleepy or dizzy. Be careful driving or operating heavy machinery (for you butch boys and girls) until you feel reasonably comfortable with the effects of the drug, which could take up to four weeks to fully develop. </p><p>You may also get dizzy when getting up from a chair or bed, so take it slowly. If you have diabetes, kidney or liver disease or seizures, consult your doctor before taking Prozac. Though the effects of Prozac on elderly patients were similar to those in younger people, there is insufficient data to rule out potential problems in the elderly who take Prozac chronically or have other illnesses.</p>",LegalAnabolic steroids,"<p>Also know as: Anavar, Deca-Durabolin, Dianabol, Nandrolone, Sustanon, Stanozolol 250. Users often refer to them simply as 'roids'.<br /><br />Homosexual men claimed less satisfaction with their bodies than their heterosexual counterparts, and experienced a greater difference between their ideal body and perceived body.

While there has been considerable interest in the side effects of anabolic steroids, little attention has been paid to the injecting behavior of anabolic steroids users,"" </p><p>While needle sharing is a common risky behavior among drug users, most gay men reported using disposable needles and syringes from sealed packets. However, gay men who use steroids are more likely to report ""HIV status unknown"" and to engage in unprotected sex with men presenting a high behavioral risk for HIV. </p><p>The increased sexual risk may be a direct consequence of the steroid use itself. Compared with men who did not use steroids, current users were more likely to be unemployed, to have had an HIV test, to be less worried about HIV in light of improved treatments, and believed that new drug therapies make people with HIV less infectious. In addition, they were more likely to report risky sexual behavior in the previous three months. They also were more likely to have been paid for having sex with a man.</p><ul><li>Inexpert injecting is very dangerous and can cause serious harm or even kill.</li><li>Sharing injecting equipment puts users at risk of dangerous infections like HIV and hepatitis.</li><li>Taking anabolic steroids carries many health risks and can stop young people from growing properly.</li></ul><br />Risks for MEN include: erection problems, breast growth, shrinking testicles, reduced sperm. Men and women both risk acne, liver disease, sterility and a narrowing of the blood vessels which can increase the risk of heart attack.",LegalValium,"<p>Also known as: diazepam, Valrelease, Vazepam, Diazepam Intensol<br /><br />Valium may be used to treat insomnia, stiff man syndrome (a rare neurological disease marked by muscle stiffness and spasms), tetanus and convulsive disorders. Although Valium was popular for many years, it has now been largely replaced by more effective medication, such as Xanax. If you're about to undergo surgery, your doctor may prescribe Valium to help you relax before your procedure.</p><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Valium is one of the class of benzodiazepines, psychotropic drugs with strong hypnotic and sedative effects. In animal studies, Valium induces a feeling of calmness by affecting parts of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus.</p><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>For the treatment of anxiety disorders, or for short-term relief of anxiety, most doctors prescribe a two to ten milligram dose, two to four times a day, as needed, depending on the severity of your symptoms. For relief of symptoms associated with acute alcohol withdrawal, your doctor may prescribe a ten milligram dose, three to four times a day for the first 24 hours, then a five milligram dose, three to four times a day thereafter, until symptoms improve. </p><p>For the relief of muscle spasms, your doctor may prescribe two to ten milligram doses, three to four times a day, as needed. For convulsive disorders, your doctor may prescribe two to ten milligram doses, two to four times a day, as needed. For both spasms and convulsions, your doctor may prescribe other types of medication along with Valium. Elderly patients or those with a debilitating disease should receive smaller doses of Valium. For these patients, your doctor may prescribe two to two-and-a-half milligram doses, once or twice a day, as needed, increasing the dosage if necessary. </p><p>For children over six months old, Valium should be administered at the lowest possible effective dose. Your doctor may prescribe one to two-and-a-half milligram doses, three to four times a day, increasing the dosage if necessary. Children six months old or younger should not take Valium. Valium is usually prescribed in tablet and capsule form, though it's also available by injection. Pills come in two, five and ten milligram doses. </p><p>If you miss a dose within an hour of when it was scheduled, take it then. If over an hour has passed since your missed dose, skip it and take your next scheduled dose as prescribed. You may take Valium with or without food. Avoid crushing or chewing medication that comes in capsule form. Since Valium can be habit-forming, those prone to alcohol or drug addiction should tell their doctors. Your doctor can then take extra precaution when prescribing this drug to you.</p><h3>What are the side effects?</h3>Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects while taking Valium: rage or irritability, slow heartbeat, confusion, difficulty breathing, hallucinations, and addiction. Less severe side effects include: fatigue, drowsiness, loss of balance (ataxia), nausea, vomiting, blurry or double vision, speech problems and feeling ""hung over."" Tell you doctor about any side effects you experience while taking Valium.<br /><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3><p>Because Valium slows down your central nervous system, you may become less mentally alert. Therefore, avoid operating heavy machinery, driving a motor vehicle or performing other activities that require complete mental alertness. Don't drink alcohol while taking Valium. Combining these two sedatives may be dangerous. Consult your doctor before taking prescription or over-the-counter drugs that induce sleep, such as cold, allergy or pain medicines, tranquilizers and sleeping pills. Valium may also dangerously interact with club drugs (see below). </p><p>You should not take Valium if you are taking Protease Inhibitors. Certain HIV medications should not be taken with Valium, Xanax, Ambien and other medications. Please consult your doctor about any medications you are currently taking to avoid drug interactions.</p><h3>Addiction</h3><p>Valium is habit-forming, and without careful medical supervision, you may become addicted to it. Always consult your doctor before increasing doses -- never increase a dose on your own. One reason people become addicted to Valium is because the drug can create a feeling of well being. </p><p>Over time, however, people build a tolerance to it, meaning higher doses of the drug must be taken to produce the same effects. Abruptly stopping Valium after longer-term use (a month or more) may result in convulsions, abdominal cramps, sweating, vomiting and tremors. Consult your doctor about gradually weaning yourself off the drug.</p><h3>Club drug interactions</h3>Some people who take ""club drugs"" such as cocaine, crystal meth or other ""uppers"" (drugs that speed up the central nervous system) may also use benzodiazepines, the class of sedatives that includes Valium and rohypnol, to bring them down from their high and induce sleep. However, combining other drugs and benzodiazepines can cause a life-threatening drug interaction, particularly if benzodiazepines are mixed with other sedatives, such as alcohol or heroin.<br /><h3>Other conditions</h3>Those with kidney or liver problems should consult their doctor before taking Valium. Those with acute narrow angle glaucoma, or who have a known sensitivity to benzodiazepines, should not take this drug.",LegalAlcohol ,"<p>Given the ubiquity of alcohol in most Western cultures, it isn't at all surprising that bars and clubs continue to be important landmarks on the gay and lesbian social landscape. Indeed, for many just coming out, bars are frequently the first and most lasting social venue for meeting other members of the community. Also known as: Booze, Hooch, Liquor</p><h3>What is it really?</h3>Alcohol is a depressant and anesthetic. When you take a drink, the alcohol is rapidly absorbed through your stomach and intestines and slows nerve impulses in your brain. As alcohol blood levels rise, you may feel giddy, uninhibited and more sociable, while you rapidly lose the ability to perform complex brain functions. Your speech becomes slurred, you have difficulty maintaining your balance, and your judgement is impaired. Your body needs water to break down alcohol and will draw it from other stores in your body if it has to. Your splitting headache the morning after results from your dehydration.<br /><h3>How is it used?</h3>In 1996, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism estimated Americans consume an average of 2.21 gallons of ethyl alcohol per person per year: the equivalent of about 50 gallons of beer, 20 gallons of wine, or five gallons of liquor for every person in the country. If the prevalence of drinking is even marginally higher in the gay community, and most social welfare and health professionals believe it is, there's a hell of a lot of drinking going on. There are, of course, varying degrees of alcohol use and abuse. But you must first realize alcohol dependency can creep up slowly on people. Alcohol is a drug, and like any drug, regular consumption can and often does lead to dependency and addiction.<br /><h3>Physiological impact</h3><p>Where to begin? First off, alcohol on its own promotes a wide range of psychological and physiological responses. Alcoholism is just one behavioral extreme and can cause a host of resulting medical conditions including liver damage and cirrhosis. Even recreational or binge drinking can have serious health consequences. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, alcohol was a contributing factor in nearly 16,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year. Strong associations between alcohol use and high-risk sexual behavior among gay men have been reported by the government since at least the early 1990s, so remember that drinking may put you at a much higher risk for catching HIV and developing AIDS. </p><p>A 1998 NIH report says that alcohol abuse carries a wide range of other possible social, legal and occupational hazards: problems with friends, loved ones, partners and family; problems at work; problems with the law; financial difficulties; greater risk of accidental injury, death and a long list of other health problems. Liver and heart disease are commonly associated with alcohol abuse. Even moderate alcohol consumption -- over the long term -- can result in hypertension (high blood pressure) or an irregular heart rate and heart disease. </p><p>Liver damage is also a risk Liver damage includes a fatty buildup with liver enlargement, abdominal discomfort and sometimes temporary jaundice and liver malfunction. Alcoholic Hepatitis is another dangerous complication and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, enlarged and tender liver, and an elevation of your white blood cell count. Sometimes alcoholic hepatitis may be present without symptoms. It can progress to cirrhosis if you continue to drink. Cirrhosis occurs in 10 percent to 15 percent of people who consume large amounts of alcohol over a long period of time.</p><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3>For people on prescription medications, alcohol can hinder the body's ability to process or metabolize the medication. This can either keep the medication in the system longer than intended or negate its effects entirely. For example, when combined with anti-depressants, alcohol's sedative effects can increase, producing dangerously high blood pressure in some people. When combined with frequently abused sedative hypnotics such as Ketamine or GHB, alcohol can greatly increase the depressant effects of these drugs and knock the user unconscious or quickly into a coma, respiratory or cardiac arrest. Recent research has revealed a potentially dangerous interaction between cocaine and alcohol. When combined, the two drugs are converted into cocaethylene in the body, which lasts longer and is more toxic than either cocaine or alcohol alone. Cocaine and alcohol is the most common two-drug combination causing drug-related deaths in the United States.",LegalCrystal,"<p>Also known as: Crystal Meth, Methamphetamine, Tina. Pronunciation: meth-am-fet-ahmeen </p><em>""The first time a friend gave me some crystal I thought it would be just like coke. Two days later, when I still couldn't sleep, and had had so much sex that I couldn't walk straight, it was obvious that it's a whole different thing. I find that crystal makes most people feel invincible and gives them tons of energy. It also makes you really horny and heightens sexual sensations, so it's a great 'sex drug'. The down side is that, like most things, you don't get nothing for free. A big Saturday night with Miss Tina (crystal) is usually followed by what is affectionately known as ""Suicide Tuesday."" It's also the most addictive thing I've ever run across, and I've had a few friends really fuck up their lives because of it. So I treat it with respect -- actually, with fear."" </em><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crystal in powder form is most commonly snorted in small doses (""bumps""). Some say the drug heightens arousal and increases sexual stamina by delaying orgasm, but impotence is just as common a side effect. Crystal produces what people describe as a giddy and euphoric wakefulness that can last several hours. Maintaining that high requires frequent re-dosing, more bumps, lines or tokes and makes crystal's potential for abuse -- even among new users -- very high. </p><h3>What is it really?</h3><p>The rush users feel comes from crystals' affect on brain chemistry. It blocks the reabsorption of a neurotransmitter, dopamine, by nerve cells. The Chemically, methamphetamines are closely related to amphetamines, but their impact on your central nervous system is more acute. Methamphetamines bear a close resemblance to two powerful chemicals in your body, dopamine and norepinephrine. These drugs affect several areas of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens, which regulates mood; the prefrontal cortex, which plays a critical role in functional memory; and the striatum, an area of your brain involved in movement. </p><h3>What is it's appeal?</h3>It's cheap, and a little goes a long way -- the high lasts much longer than cocaine. It can make you feel giddy, euphoric and confident. When it comes time to fuck, you can go all night, and then some. <p>""Crystal methamphetamine is described as the hyper-sexual drug,"" says Perry Halkitis, M.S., Ph.D, professor at New York University, and co-director of the Center for HIV Educational Studies and Training (CHEST). ""It makes you horny."" </p><p>But like all drugs -- and erections -- what goes up, must come down.</p><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>Methamphetamine can be swallowed in pill form, snorted as a powder, injected into your bloodstream, or smoked. Methamphetamine is neurotoxic. If you ingest it, the rush you experience comes from the forced release of serotonin and dopamine in your brain. Some users report that they feel ""normal"" or even ""superhuman"" after losing a night or two of sleep because of the drug. There may also be a feeling of being sharp or in control, feeling confident of being able to pass at work, or fool family members. While enjoyable, this confidence is misplaced, certainly artificial and, of course, temporary. </p><p>Wanting to prolong the high and delay the inevitable crash another hour, another evening or another day -- is emblematic of the drug's addictive character. Depriving your body of sleep exacerbates the chemical impact of the drug on your brain. You become irritable, anxious, afraid, confused, aggressive and you may even experience bouts of delusional paranoia. In other words, you become a pleasure to be with. <a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a></p><h3>What are the side effects?</h3><p>The short term consequences of cocaine use include depression (sometimes severe), anxiety, irritability, isolation, tremors, lethargy, fatigue, nightmares, headache, sweating, muscle and stomach cramps. The medical complications associated with cocaine use are enormous. Some of the most frequent complications are cardiovascular effects, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks. Cocaine use has been linked to many types of heart disease. </p><p>Cocaine has been found to trigger chaotic heart rhythms, called ventricular fibrillation; accelerate heartbeat and breathing; and increase blood pressure and body temperature. Physical symptoms may include chest pain, nausea, blurred vision, fever, muscle spasms, convulsions and coma. Other complications include respiratory effects such as chest pain and respiratory failure; neurological effects, including strokes, seizure, and headaches; and gastrointestinal complications, including abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting. </p><h3>Physiological impact</h3>Methamphetamine carries a high potential for abuse and dependence and the health consequences associated with prolonged use are serious. The March 2001 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry, found that meth use depletes the brain of dopamine transporters, which allow dopamine -- a brain chemical that affects feelings of satisfaction and pleasure -- to be absorbed back into the nerve cells that produce it. The depletion of these transporters may make meth users more susceptible to Parkinson's Disease, a brain disorder associated with dopamine deficiency and characterized by shaking and difficulty with walking, movement, and coordination. <br /><br />More immediate methamphetamine dangers include a sharp spike in blood pressure, dangerously irregular heartbeats, chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The drug can increase body temperature to critical levels, provoking cascading failures in vital systems. Brain hemorrhage is perhaps the biggest risk associated with use and abuse of the drug, which if not fatal, can cause permanent paralysis and speech loss. <br /><br />You may think that recreational or occasional use can be handled and, perhaps in your case it can, but realize that no one who is physically addicted to or dependent on methamphetamine set out to get hooked. <br /><br />Given the drug's powerful impact on the sex drives of male users, Crystal meth is one of the most dangerous drugs in terms of its tendency to override making rational choices such as protecting yourself and your partner from the transmission of STDs, including HIV. <br /><a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a><h3>STD/HIV impact</h3><p>The use of crystal methamphetamine is one of several factors that may be fueling increases in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among gay and bisexual men in the United States, according to new research presented at the 2004 National STD Prevention Conference. One day following the release of preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing the third consecutive year of increases in syphilis cases in 2003, findings presented provide crucial insight into the factors behind increasing STD diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM).</p><p>Three studies indicate that crystal methamphetamine (crystal) use is associated with high-risk behavior and infection with STDs, including HIV, among MSM in San Francisco. A CDC study of 388 MSM found that 16 percent used the drug the last time they had anal sex. Crystal users in that study were twice as likely as non-users to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse. </p><p>Researchers at the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) found that MSM who used crystal and Viagra together were 6.1 times more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis than those who did not use either drug. In another study from SFDPH, researchers found that 17.4 percent of 1,263 MSM who attended the city's public STD clinic had used crystal in the four weeks before their visit. Those who used the drug were more than twice as likely as non-users to be HIV infected, 4.9 times as likely to be diagnosed with syphilis, and 1.7 times as likely to test positive for gonorrhea.</p><p><em>""The increased threat of syphilis and other STDs among gay and bisexual men is being driven in part by a troubling combination of drug use and complacency,"" said Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, deputy director of the HIV, STD and TB prevention programs at CDC</em>, <em>one of the conference's sponsors. ""Efforts to reduce the impact of STDs among gay and bisexual men must address these underlying factors.""</em></p><p>As HIV rates continue to climb among gay and bisexual men, studies point to a clear connection between crystal, unsafe sex, and HIV risk. While high, you might be more likely to bareback, have multiple sex partners, have rougher, more aggressive sex, and bottom -- all risky behaviors. </p><h3>Being HIV positive and meth use </h3>Crystal is ranked among the most popular drugs among HIV-positive men in several cities including New York, Miami, and San Francisco. While mainstream communities are finding a spike in addiction, gay and bisexual men are hit with a double whammy -- an increase in addiction and HIV. <p><em>""Crystal can suppress the part of your immune system that is responsible for actually blocking HIV,"" says Antonio Urbina, M.D., Assistant Professor of Medicine at New York Medical College.</em></p><p>For HIV-positive men, there are potentially fatal drug interactions between crystal and protease inhibitors, especially Norvir, says Dr. Urbina. Because Norvir and crystal share a common pathway, crystal may be three to ten times more potent in people taking Norvir. </p><p>This is not a reason to stop taking your HIV medications, which will only increase the likelihood that you will develop resistance to medications. While Dr. Urbina says abstinence is the only way to go with crystal, if you can't stop at this moment, strongly consider doing a much smaller amount. The combination, however, can be deadly.</p><p><em>""We may also see more HIV-associated dementia for men with HIV,"" Dr. Urbina says.</em></p><p>Crystal and HIV have overlapping toxicity, that may cause irreversible damage to the brain. </p><p>Methemphatamine may actually increase viral replication in the brain, says Dr. Halkitis, who has worked on several studies regarding club drugs and HIV. ""Also, a lot of men with HIV who are using meth, are not adhering to medication regimens."" This puts HIV-negative men at greater risk for catching a drug resistant strain of the virus.</p><h3>Eat, drink, sleep </h3>Partying with drugs isn't easy. Those harsh speed chemicals and sleepless weekends can really do a number on your body - and your mind. Your body and brain need the proper amount of food, water, and sleep to minimize the damage caused by drug use. And to recover when the party's over!<br /><br />There's another benefit, too. Many users say they have more enjoyable highs and less paranoia when they eat, drink enough water, and get some sleep. Eating, drinking, and sleeping can make the crash a lot easier, too. Taking care of your body can -- and should -- become a regular part of getting high. It's easier than you may think! <br /><h3>Rule #1 EAT</h3><ul><li>Even if you're not hungry! Your body needs all the fuel it can get. </li><li>Stock your fridge or your backpack BEFORE you get high. Your favorite foods will be more appealing, so keep plenty around. </li><li>Small, frequent snacks may be easier than eating just one larger meal. </li><li>If eating while high is difficult, then at least eat well before you get high. Be sure to eat when coming down, too.</li><li>Even though you will probably crave it, resist the urge to binge on sugar! Foods like cookies, pastries, or candy bars can cause mood swings and increase drug cravings. They can also send your blood sugar levels on a rollercoaster ride! Instead, eat more protein. High-protein foods have more nutrients and will give you energy that lasts longer than a quick sugar boost. </li><li>Triple grande mochas with extra whipped cream are NOT food! Despite the small amount of milk and some calories, lattes and mochas offer little nutrition. The sugar and caffeine aren't helpful either. If you must have coffee, stick to decaf with no chocolate or flavorings. </li></ul><strong>Any food is better than no food. But some foods are better than others:</strong> <table border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"" class=""statTbl"" align=""center""><tbody><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#ffffff"">Good foods:</font></strong></td><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#ffffff"">Not-so-good foods:</font></strong></td></tr><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><font color=""#ffffff"">burgers<br />sandwiches<br />yogurt<br />cheese<br />milk <br />pizza<br />burritos <br />protein or sports bars<br />fruits<br />veggies <br /></font></td><td class=""copy""><font color=""#ffffff"">cookies<br />pastries<br />candy bars<br />white bread products<br />lattes and mochas<br />ice cream<br />milkshakes</font></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br /><strong>What about vitamins and nutritional supplements?</strong><br />Regular drug use can deplete your body of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. This can cause changes in metabolism, brain chemistry, and normal body functions. Taking a good multi-vitamin can help, but it can't replace actual food, water, or sleep. Talk to your doctor, nutritionist, naturopath, or reputable health food store professional about the right type and dose of multi-vitamin for you. Nutritional supplements like Ensure, Boost, or instant breakfast drinks are great ways to get quick nutrition and hydrate at the same time. Most don't need to be refrigerated, so they're easy to carry. Nutrition or protein bars are handy too! </p><h3><a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a>Rule #2 DRINK WATER </h3><p>Your body needs water to handle the stress of crystal and being high. Without enough water, your crash will be harder than normal. When you're high, your kidneys need more water to process the drugs from your body. How much should you drink? At least 8 glasses a day and more when you're high! How much you drink is just as important as what you drink. Alcoholic drinks actually cause you to lose more fluid than you gain. Drinks with caffeine or lots of sugar may quench your thirst, but they don't hydrate your body. </p><table border=""1"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" width=""100%"" class=""statTbl"" align=""center""><tbody><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#ffffff"">Drink More :</font></strong></td><td class=""copy""><strong><font color=""#ffffff"">Avoid or Drink Less:</font></strong></td></tr><tr align=""center"" valign=""top""><td class=""copy""><font color=""#ffffff"">water - bottled flavored, tonic, whatever <br /><br />fruit juice - 100% juice, not ""juice drinks""<br /><br />gatorade or sports drinks</font></td><td class=""copy""><font color=""#ffffff"">coffee or tea<br />soda pop <br />flavored iced teas<br />alcohol<br />beer</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><strong>Getting the hydration you need:</strong> <ul><li>Make a ""water plan."" Stock your fridge with healthy beverages before you get high.</li><li>Carry a water bottle with you. </li><li>Order tonic water or juice at a club instead of alcohol. </li><li>Suck on ice chips. </li><li>Drink BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER your high. </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do I need more water? YES, if:</strong> </p><ol><li>Your urine is dark yellow -or</li><li>You have cotton mouth -or </li><li>You pinch the skin on the back of your hand and it doesn't snap back. </li></ol><p><br /><strong>If you are HIV-positive: </strong><br />Some HIV medications require you to drink extra water or stick to certain meal plans. Not drinking enough water can have painful results - like kidney stones! If you're taking these medications AND getting high, you'll need to be extra careful about your food and water intake. Let your doctor know that you are using drugs and ask questions about the meds you are taking. </p><h3><a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a>Rule #3 GET SOME SLEEP </h3><p>Do you see strange things, hear voices, or have paranoia when you're high? It could be from sleep deprivation. You may be able to avoid or lessen a lot of weird ""tweak behavior"" with just a few hours of sleep. A simple nap can help keep your mind more focused and your thinking clearer. Tips for sleep: </p><ul><li>Don't stay up longer than 2-3 days. Know how much crystal is ""too much."" </li><li>Take some ""down time"" during your high to relax and be quiet from constant activity. This may take some ""training"" until it becomes a habit. </li><li>Sometimes short catnaps can take the rough edges off a high. </li><li>Do you have a place to sleep when you need to? If your own home isn't an option, what about a friend's place? </li><li>Don't mix downers with speed!!! Using heroin, sleeping pills, or tranquilizers to come down can cause serious, even fatal, effects on your heart and blood pressure</li></ul>",IllegalCocaine,"<p>Also known as: ""Blow"", Coke, ""Toot"", ""C"", ""Candy"", ""Charlie"", ""Snow"" </p><em>""It used to be fun. We'd pick up a little before hitting the clubs and it was, you know a lift, a little rush. But after a little while, the all nighters weren't all that uncommon. We did them all the time -- every weekend. And the people around me, my friends, started to change. It has that effect on people. It starts becoming about the drug. Who's carrying, who's freeloading, and how much you'll need to get you through the weekend. Now it's like I can't even have a couple of drinks without thinking about it. I don't have control over it anymore.""</em>Though cocaine has been eclipsed by methamphetamine use in many gay and lesbian urban centers, it remains a serious problem and chronic health concern for members of the community.<br /><h3>What is it really?</h3>The rush users feel comes from cocaine's affect on brain chemistry. It blocks the reabsorption of a neurotransmitter, dopamine, by nerve cells. The resulting buildup of this chemical produces an abnormally high and continuous stimulation of dopamine receptors resulting in the brief cocaine high. Cocaine is extremely addictive and it is important to note here that there are many different levels of addiction. Even infrequent users can be drawn into more regular usage because of cocaine's pleasurable associations.<br /><h3>How is it used?</h3><p>When cocaine is snorted or injected, the high can last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or three to five minutes with crack cocaine. Cocaine is highly addictive. As the effect of the drug wears off, the user feels an intense craving for another dose. Dependency develops rapidly. Some research indicates that a psychological dependency may develop after a single dose of high-potency cocaine. Over a period of time, the amount of cocaine needed and the frequency of use to achieve a ""high"" have to be increased. </p><p>This down feeling leads the addict to use more cocaine, sometimes just to feel ""normal."" Feelings of depression can become chronic. Cocaine use in large gay urban centers is frequently associated with binge usage centered around nightclubs, bars, baths and sex clubs that are open all night. The problem, say many users, is that what was once a ""special"" purchase becomes more and more frequent.</p><h3>What are the side effects?</h3><p>The short term consequences of cocaine use include depression (sometimes severe), anxiety, irritability, isolation, tremors, lethargy, fatigue, nightmares, headache, sweating, muscle and stomach cramps. The medical complications associated with cocaine use are enormous. Some of the most frequent complications are cardiovascular effects, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks. Cocaine use has been linked to many types of heart disease. Cocaine has been found to trigger chaotic heart rhythms, called ventricular fibrillation; accelerate heartbeat and breathing; and increase blood pressure and body temperature. </p><p>Physical symptoms may include chest pain, nausea, blurred vision, fever, muscle spasms, convulsions and coma. Other complications include respiratory effects such as chest pain and respiratory failure; neurological effects, including strokes, seizure, and headaches; and gastrointestinal complications, including abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting.</p><h3>Physiological impact</h3><p>A marked tolerance to the high produced by cocaine is common. Many addicts report they seek but fail to achieve as much pleasure as they did from their first experience. Users typically increase their doses to intensify and prolong the effects of the drug. And while user tolerance to the high develops, users can also become more sensitized to cocaine's anesthetic and convulsant properties, without increasing their dosage. </p><p>The increased sensitivity has been attributed to some deaths occurring after apparently low doses of cocaine. Cocaine in high doses will kill you. Cocaine-related deaths are often a result of cardiac arrest or seizures followed by respiratory arrest.</p><h3>Dangerous complication/interactions</h3>The mixture of cocaine and alcohol is the most common two-drug combination that results in drug-related death. Taken in combination, the two drugs are converted by the body to cocaethylene. Cocaethylene has a longer duration of action in the brain and is more toxic than either drug alone. <br /><a class=""slink"" href=""#top""></a>",IllegalDrugs & Complications,"Awareness to the effects of party drugs is necessary to reducing the prevalence of these diseases, which can cause lifelong effects and death.  <strong>Lifestyle factors</strong> common to many gay men may exacerbate the inherently dangerous use of street drugs. For example, bars are prominent in the social landscape of many GBTQ communities, and alcohol is equally common at circuit parties. Mixing party drugs with alcohol can not only cast aside discretion, it can be deadly. <p>Furthermore, while drugs like ""poppers"" increase heart rate and relax muscles, they also dilate blood vessels and cause the heart to pump blood vigorously. When used prior to anal sex (as they often are) they increase the risk for anal bleeding and STDs if an anal tear or sore is present.  The following is a list of primary and secondary risk factors associated with drug use:  </p><ul> <li>Abundance of dangerous homemade synthetics on the street (made from paint thinner, cyanide, etc.)</li>  <li>Dependency (need for more in light of the withdrawal effects of many party drugs, which include lethargy and depression) </li> <li>Heart attack, stroke, respiratory failure (dangerous effects of drugs combined with the rigors of physical exertion and sex) </li> <li>Heat stroke, exhaustion, severe dehydration (with dancing, especially in venues with inadequate climate control) </li> <li>Hepatitis and other STDs (through unsafe sex and sharing contaminated needles) </li> <li>HIV and AIDS (through unsafe sex and sharing contaminated needles) </li> <li>Incarceration (illegal possession of controlled substances) </li> <li>Increased risk for anal bleeding </li> <li>Long-term neurotoxicity (permanent nerve damage, psychosis) </li> <li>Unconsciousness, seizures, death (resulting from mixing drugs or mixing drugs and alcohol</li> </ul>",Things to ConsiderHepatitis B,"Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver cancer and even death. New infections of Hepatitis B per year have declined from an average of 260,000 in the 1980s to about 78,000 in 2001. 1.25 million Americans are estimated to have chronic (life-long) hepatitis B infections. Before HIV, hepatitis B was the most dangerous sexually transmitted infection gay men faced. The good news is, a vaccine is available that can prevent you from ever getting Hepatitis B. Remember, though, that this vaccination won't protect you from hepatitis A. Likewise, a hepatitis A vaccine won't protect you from hepatitis B.<br /><h3>What is it?</h3><p>Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks your liver. Nearly all infants and children and 50% of adults with a new infection have no symptoms whatsoever.</p><p>Many men and women don't know that they had hepatitis, unless they have a blood test that shows that they were infected. You can find hepatitis B virus in blood, semen and other bodily fluids of infected individuals, and they can transmit it through unsafe anal or vaginal sex, shared needles, toothbrushes, razors, tattoo equipment or sex toys.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Hepatitis B symptoms are extremely variable, both in severity and duration. Some people get deathly ill, most others don't even realize they are sick. The most common symptom is profound fatigue -- some feel that they can't even get out of bed. Other common symptoms include nausea and vomiting (generally worsening as the day progresses), loss of appetite, fever, muscle aches and a dull upper abdominal discomfort. Loss of a desire for cigarettes is a classic sign of hepatitis. Most people develop jaundice (they turn a lovely shade of yellow, most noticeable in the whites of their eyes). This results from your liver's inability to process bile. Your urine darkens and your stool can turn to a sand color.</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3><p>Hepatitis B is diagnosed with blood tests that check for different types of antibodies in the blood. Hepatitis B antibodies differ from those found with other types of hepatitis. A doctor may decide to give you a blood test if you are having symptoms or if you are concerned about a possible exposure to Hepatitis B.</p><h3>How is it acquired?</h3><p>Hepatitis B virus can be found in an infected individual's blood, semen and other bodily fluids. You are contagious before you know you are sick and for sometime after you feel better. People with chronic hepatitis are always infectious. Men who have sex with men are at high risk for hepatitis B. Spread occurs through contact with virus-containing blood and body fluids, such as: </p><ul><li>sharing of injection drug equipment</li><li>sharing of tatooing or piercing tools</li><li>anal, oral or vaginal sex</li><li>sharing sex toys</li><li>during childbirth</li><li>household contact with a person who has hepatitis B, and sharing of personal hygiene items (such as nail clippers, razors, toothbrushes).</li></ul><p>The amount of virus is highest in blood and serous fluid (yellowish or clear fluid that drains from cuts/sores) but is also present in smaller amounts in semen, vaginal fluids, and menstrual blood.</p><p>Although small amounts of virus can be found in saliva, saliva is not likely to spread hepatitis B, unless saliva from an infected person gets into a cut or sore, for example, following a bite.</p><p>Hepatitis B is not spread by kissing or sneezing.</p><h3>How to treat it?</h3><p>There are no medications designed specifically to treat acute hepatitis. Treatment is generally described as ""supportive,"" with the key components being rest, good nutrition, and careful monitoring to be sure your liver recovers. Nausea is common with hepatitis and because it often worsens as the day progresses, most doctors recommend that you eat your bigger meals earlier. Medication can help those with severe nausea. </p><p>Hospitalization is rare, but occasionally necessary if you cannot take in adequate food and water or if you are too weak to remain at home. Avoid all alcohol and drugs, which further tax your liver, until you are fully recovered (which should be determined by your doctor and not by symptoms that go away). See your doctor regularly to monitor your liver function and nutritional status.If hepatitis B virus remains in your blood for more than six months, you probably have a chronic infection. Most doctors recommend a liver biopsy before any further treatment. If your biopsy shows signs of continued liver destruction, you should talk to your doctor about your treatment options. </p><p>Current approved therapy for HCV-related chronic liver disease includes alpha interferon alone or in combination with the oral agent ribavirin for a duration of 6--12 months. The FDA recently approved a new form of Interferon that requires fewer doses a week. It is important to discuss the latest treatment options with a specialists knowledgeable about this virus.Interferon therapy, however, can have many side effects. You can develop severe fevers and shaking chills. Many people find that interferon triggers bouts of serious depression. Interferon works best in men without HIV.</p><p>Some doctors treat chronic hepatitis with the antiretroviral medication, Epivir HBV (lamivudine), which targets an enzyme required for the reproduction of the hepatitis B virus. This drug is taken orally and is approved for treatment of hepatitis B by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Side effects include headache, nausea, fatigue and diarrhea. This drug may cause an inflammation of the pancreas in children, which can be life threatening. Side effects vary depending upon the patient, and can be mild to severe.</p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3><p>Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions. </p><ul><li>Hepatitis A vaccine will not protect you from hepatitis B and vice versa.</li><li>Once you have had hepatitis B, you cannot catch it again.</li><li>You cannot catch hepatitis from the vaccine.</li></ul><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated. Hepatitis B is completely preventable with a series of three shots given over six months (you need all three shots for the vaccine to work). Despite the fact that doctors recommend that all men who have sex with men get vaccinated, less than half do. </p><p>If you think you've been exposed to hepatitis B but have never had the vaccine, your doctor can give you an immediate injection of immune globulin that contains antibodies to hepatitis and can keep you from catching the virus. You should combine this with the regular vaccine. Today, all newborns in the United States are vaccinated for hepatitis B, and this will hopefully translate into reduced risk in years to come.</p><p>The elderly and people with chronic illness, including HIV, tend to get sicker from hepatitis. Hepatitis B infection is all the more dangerous for those who already have chronic hepatitis C, or liver damage from some other cause (e.g. alcohol).<br />People with HIV or compromised immunity from other causes are more likely to develop chronic hepatitis than those with normal immunity. If you have HIV, you should still be vaccinated against hepatitis B.</p><h3>Incubation period</h3><p>Symptoms usually begin six weeks to six months after exposure to hepatitis B. Keep in mind that many infected people don't develop any symptoms and can spread this disease unknowingly!</p>",STDs & ConditionsHepatitis A,"<h3>What is it? </h3><p>Hepatitis A is a virus that infects your liver cells. The disease begins slowly, and many times you don't even realize that you have it. In fact, you find out at some future date that you have antibodies to the virus, which indicates a prior infection. Hepatitis A is rarely fatal, but hospitalization may be required to control its symptoms. Unlike other types of hepatitis, type A does not become chronic. The illness generally runs its course in six to eight weeks and your liver fully recovers. You're usually contagious before you know you are ill. Rapid destruction of your liver (fulminate hepatitis) occurs in less than one percent of cases. Usually fulminate hepatitis only happens to someone whose liver has previously been damaged (e.g. chronic alcoholism or infection with Hepatitis C).</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3>Doctors diagnose hepatitis A with a blood test that measures your liver function. Inflammation of the liver can destroy its cells, and liver enzymes spill into your blood. If your blood test reveals these enzymes at an elevated level, you probably have hepatitis, and your doctors will then search for the cause. Hepatitis A is specifically diagnosed by checking your blood for antibodies to the virus. When any of these are present, you have or have had the infection. <br /><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Feeling tired is the most common symptom (you may feel like you can't get out of bed), followed by loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting (that worsens as the day progresses) and for smokers, loss of your desire for cigarettes. Jaundice (when your skin and eyes turn yellow) is also a very common symptom, as is darkening of your urine. You might also have a dull pain in your upper abdomen. In severe cases, you may have problems with bleeding and poor blood clotting (your liver manufactures substances crucial to blood clotting; liver damage hurts the process).</p><p>Hepatitis A passes between people via a ""fecal/oral"" route. The virus lives in the liver and is passed in the stool. The virus enters another person when hands, food, or objects contaminated with stool are put in the mouth. The amount of contamination needed to spread the infection is very small and is not visible to the eye.We sometimes hear of Hepatitis A outbreaks when a restaurant worker is infected and does not thoroughly wash his/her hands after going to the bathroom and then contaminates food.Countries that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢thave good sewage treatment systems often have endemic Hepatitis A because it can be spread through drinking water or eating shellfish contaminated with the virus.</p><p>Hepatitis A can also be spread through sexual activity. And no, you don't have to eat shit: if hands or mouth come in contact with stool or parts of the body contaminated with stool, hepatitis A infection can be transmitted. Rimming an infected partner can give you the virus. You also risk infection when you take off a condom after anal sex and forget to wash your fingers before they end up in your mouth.A person is most contagious during the 2 weeks before the illness symptoms begin.</p><p>Hepatitis A is not spread by kissing, sneezing, or by saliva.<br />Eating raw shellfish from contaminated waters or food prepared by infected workers can also give you hepatitis A.</p><h3>How to treat it?</h3><p>There's no medication to treat hepatitis A once you have it. Often, treatment is commonly called ""supportive"": your nutrition level and liver function are carefully monitored by your doctor. You mustn't drink alcohol, no matter what type of hepatitis you have, until your liver completely heals. If you get nauseous, try to eat more in the morning, when nausea is usually less severe. You must get lots of rest. The more tender love and care (TLC) you receive from loved ones, the better you'll feel. Hospitalization is rare, and you may be given medication to decrease nausea. Anyone with hepatitis A should be vaccinated against hepatitis B.</p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3><p>Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions. </p><ul><li>Hepatitis A is not the same as hepatitis B or C.</li><li>Nor is hepatitis A is the only form of infectious hepatitis.</li><li>Once you have had hepatitis B, you cannot catch it again.</li></ul><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Hepatitis A is a completely preventable disease, and vaccination will prevent infection. The vaccines for Hepatitis A and B are different, and one won't protect you from the other! If you've previously had hepatitis A, you can't catch it again. The hepatitis A vaccine is given in two doses spaced 6 to 12 months apart. Most people become immune within one month of the first injection. The vaccine is extremely safe, and the most common side effect is a sore arm.</p><p>If you're exposed to hepatitis A and are not immune to it, you can get an immune globulin shot within two weeks of exposure to help keep you from becoming infected. Immune globulin (IG) is a blood plasma product that can prevent hepatitis A if given within 14 days of exposure to an infected individual. IG is effective 80-90% of the time. IG is necessary if the exposed person has not been vaccinated against hepatitis A and has never had a hepatitis A infection. Immune globulin provides protection against hepatitis A for about 3 months, vaccine is needed for long-term protection. </p><p>Immune globulin may be recommended for you if you: </p><ul><li>Live with someone who has hepatitis A.</li><li>Have eaten food or put objects in your mouth handled by a person infected with hepatitis A.</li><li>Have had sexual or other intimate contact with a person who has hepatitis A.</li><li>Are traveling to an area where hepatitis A is common (see above list).</li><li>Are a child attending, or an employee of a child care program in which another child or employee has hepatitis A.</li></ul><p>There's no need to barricade yourself from someone with hepatitis A. If you get vaccinated against hepatitis to begin with, then you won't have to worry!Hepatitis A is a common STD for men who have sex with men.Of particular concern to ethnic<br />Cultures known to eat raw seafood have higher incidence of hepatitis A.</p><h3>Incubation period</h3><p>The incubation period is extremely variable, but it averages two to six weeks.Sex<br />Refrain from sex with a partner who has hepatitis A until the infection is completely gone. Rimming is a common way for hepatitis A to pass between partners. Not washing your hands after touching a used condom can lead to a hepatitis A infection.</p><h3>Prevalence</h3><p>There are 125,000 to 200,000 hepatitis A infections and about 100 subsequent deaths each year in the United States. Thirty-three percent of Americans have evidence of a prior hepatitis A infection. Areas with high rates of hepatitis A include: South America, Africa, Greenland and Asia. The Soviet Union also has an increased prevalence of hepatitis A.</p>",STDs & ConditionsChlamydia,"<h3>What is it?</h3><p>Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is any infection of your urethra caused by an organism other than gonorrhea. Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are the most common organisms that cause this infection. Other bacteria can cause the infection, especially if you put foreign objects (and other toys) into your urethra. Men who require frequent catheterizations to remove their urine also frequently develop urethritis from other types of bacteria.</p><h3>Diagnosis</h3><p>Doctors diagnose the infection by examining your penile discharge under a microscope. If you have a noticeable discharge, your doctor will collect it on a cotton swab. If it's minimal, he/she will try to ""milk"" a little of it out of your urethra. When this fails, the last alternative (please don't squirm) is for your doctor to pass a tiny (emphasis on tiny) swab into your urethra. </p><p>Don't worry, it doesn't go in very far. When doctors examine the discharge produced by NGU under a microscope, they typically see many white blood cells without gonorrhea bacteria hence the name non-gonoccoal urethritis. Chlamydia is diagnosed by doing a test for Chlamydia trachomatis (the bacteria that causes the infection) from sites that might have been exposed. Usually this means taking a swab from the penis in men, from the cervix in women (during a pelvic exam), or from the rectum. Sometimes urine can be tested. </p><p>The specimen is sent to a laboratory for testing and results are available a few days later. Nucleic acid amplification tests are new, very reliable tests for diagnosing gonorhea and chlamydia. They are more accurate that the traditional culture tests. Tests for chlamydia usually become positive 3 - 7 days after catching the infection.Because of high rates of re-infection (e.g. your partner doesn't go in and get treated and gives it to you again) Everyone with chlamydia should be re-tested 3 - 4 months after treatment. Retesting usually can be done on a urine sample.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>It is common to have an infection without having symptoms. If you have symptoms, they most commonly will be burning with urination (dysuria) and a penile discharge. Typically these symptoms are much milder than what you'd experience with a urethritis from gonorrhea. In NGU the discomfort can vary from severe to little more than an annoyance. You can have a minimal discharge that only shows up as a stain on your underwear. The discharge may be clear or only mildly infected. (Gonorrhea produces a green/yellow discharge.)</p><h3>How is it acquired?<br /></h3><p>'Cobblestone' Chlamydia Eye Infection NGU is often a sexually transmitted infection. It can also be found in your throat and anus. Older men with prostate enlargement or men who have frequent catheterizations (passing a catheter down your urethra to your bladder to empty urine) are also at risk for developing urethritis. </p><p>In these cases, many different types of bacteria can cause the infection. Men who pass foreign objects into their urethra are also at risk for infections. In addition to chlamydia (which can be found in a partner's throat), you can also develop urethritis from other bacteria that are normally present in a partner's mouth and then spread to your urethra during unprotected oral sex. If untreated the infection can spread from your urethra to your epididymis and prostate. </p><p>You can even spread it to other parts of your own body. Chlamydia is one of the most common STDs to infect your eye. And no, you didn't get it because some guy hit the target: your fingers most likely spread it there.</p><h3>How to treat it?</h3><p>Most cases of NGU are caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and UU and doctors will often treat you for these infections. Many doctors will also treat you for gonorrhea at the same time. Sometimes a single dose of antibiotic is sufficient, but other antibiotics must be taken for 7 days. Important: Many common antibiotics do not work against chlamydia. Never treat yourself with an antibiotic left over from another prescription.</p><p>People should not have sex for 7 days after treatment is completed. Recent sex partners must also be treated. A couple must not have sex until both have completed treatment; otherwise they may reinfect one another.The most common treatment for NGU is azithromycin (Zithromax) in a single one gram dose. Alternative treatments include tetracycline or doxycicline for one<br />to two weeks.</p><h3>Myths dispelled</h3><p>Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions. </p><ul><li>You don't get urethritis from toilet seats, unless perhaps someone else is sitting on your lap.</li></ul><h3>Prevention </h3><p>Abstinence from sexual activity is the surest way to avoid becoming infected with chlamydia--not having any anal, oral or vaginal sex.</p><p>The next surest way is to limit sex to one uninfected partner who only has sex with you--mutual monogamy. A condom will help protect you, but it must be worn for foreplay and oral sex.</p><p>Avoid sex if suspicious symptoms are present.</p><p>f you think you could have chlamydia (or any STD), seek immediate care at a local STD clinic, hospital, or medical practitioner.<br />Before having sex, talk with your partner(s) about chlamydia and other STDs.</p><p>f you have chlamydia (or any STD), notify all sex partners so that they can also seek and obtain treatment. If you feel that you cannot tell your sex partners, public health can help notify them. Ask to speak to any disease intervention specialist.A condom will help prevent urethritis. You can catch urethritis when you insert your penis into someone's mouth or anus without a condom on. NGU is very common in men. Symptoms may be mild and many men do not realize they have the infection. </p><p>They can unwittingly spread it to partners. Chlamydia and UU can also infect your mouth and anus. If you pass foreign objects into your urethra you can cause an infection (urethritis). Men with penile piercings that pass through the urethra are also more likely to develop a urethritis which may not be sexually transmitted. As men age they develop prostate enlargement (BPH) and may have difficulty urinating. Catheters can cause urethritis. Urethritis is rare in women because your urethra is so short (you can figure out why). Chlamydia infections of the female genital tract are, however, very common. Urethritis is an STD. If you have this infection you are at increased risk for catching or transmitting HIV.</p><h3>Incubation period</h3><p>NGU has a longer and more variable incubation period than gonorrhea. Typically symptoms begin one to five weeks after the onset of infection.</p><h3>Sex</h3><p>Most cases of NGU are caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A condom will protect you. You can catch urethritis from oral or anal sex.</p><h3>Prevalence</h3><p>There are over four million new cases each year in the U.S. In Kansas Chlamydia was one of the most frequently reported dieases. Among reported cases of bacterial STDs, racial and ethnic minorities are disproprotionately represented. Females represent (83% KS 59% MO) of the chalamydia cases. Among Black males, 37.4% of the cases reported were among individuals age 20 to 24 and 21.8% of the cases were in individuals age 15 to 19.</p>",STDs & ConditionsHIV,"<p> AIDS has transformed American  culture. It has galvanized the community of gay men -- and to some  extent, lesbians -- and brought them to the attention of mainstream  culture with both good and bad results. Public perception has changed  a great deal over the decades -- although not enough -- and treatment  has too.</p> <p>While the prognosis for people with HIV used to be very grim, the advent of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) has radically changed this for many people. It is now possible for many people with HIV to delay further damage to their immune systems and lead relatively normal lives for years. Beginning in 1996, the number of deaths from AIDS started dropping dramatically. Unfortunately, this trend has leveled off in the past few years and 2001 saw an increase in the number of AIDS cases in the United States.</p><p>Anti-retroviral therapy has been proven to slow disease progression and extend life, but it does not eradicate the virus and is not a ""cure."" In order for anti-retroviral therapy to be effective, the drugs must be used consistently and correctly. It can be difficult for people to take a large number of pills at exactly the right times, day after day. HAART also has many side-effects.  And treatment is very expensive, which prevents it from being available to everyone</p>",HIVSyphilis,"  <p>Although physicians have been able to successfully treat syphilis since the advent of penicillin in 1943, many cases still go undiagnosed. If ignored, the disease can be fatal.</p><h3>What is it?  </h3><p>Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the corkscrew  shaped bacteria (spirochete) Treponema pallidum. The bacteria lands  on your body during sex with an infected partner. The most common  sites of infection are the penis, anus or vagina. Within 90 days of  infection (two to four weeks average) a red, painless ulcer called  a chancre appears. The chancre, though usually singular, can be multiple,  and will heal even without treatment within three to eight weeks.  Syphilis cannot be spread through contact with toilet seats, doorknobs,  swimming pools, hot tubs, bathtubs, shared clothing, or eating utensils.  <br /> <br />  This first stage of infection is called primary syphilis. The chancre  weeps a clear fluid that is chock full of syphilis-causing bacteria,  and it is during this stage that you are highly contagious. After  the chancre heals, the bacteria spread throughout your body. This  is called secondary syphilis. Infected individuals usually complain  of fever, joint pains, fatigue, liver problems, enlarged lymph nodes,  eye problems and a copper colored skin rash that usually appears on  your palms and soles. You  are still contagious at this stage. If untreated, 40 percent of infected  individuals progress to Tertiary Syphilis within 10 to 20 years. Although  no longer contagious, the disease can prove lethal, as it attacks  your brain, your heart valves and major arteries (most commonly the  aorta). And more bad news: even if you've had syphilis once before  and were cured, you can still catch it again. <br /> </p><h3>Diagnosis</h3>  In 1906, Dr. August von Wassermann developed the first test to diagnose  syphilis (The Wassermann). Some physicians use a darkfield microscope  to examine a sample of fluid from your chancre. You have syphilis  if they see the spirochete bacteria. Today the most common test for  syphilis is a blood test that looks for antibodies to the spirochete.  It is called a VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or FTA-ABS  (florescent treponemal antibody absorption) test. Another blood test  often used to confirm the presence of active infection is called an  RPR (rapid plasma reagin).  <p>Syphilis may be harder to diagnose in people with HIV or other immune compromised individuals who do not make antibodies to the infection. In other words, they may have syphilis despite a negative blood test. </p><h3>Symptoms</h3>  <strong>Primary syphilis:</strong> <p>A painless red ulcer called a chancre. The chancre can appear within 10 days to three months after exposure, but it generally appears within two to six weeks. Because the chancre may be painless and may occur inside the body, it may go unnoticed. It usually is found on the part of the body exposed to the partner's ulcer, such as the penis, the vulva, or the vagina. A chancre also can develop on the cervix, tongue, lips, or other parts of the body. The chancre disappears within a few weeks whether or not a person is treated. If not treated during the primary stage, about one-third of people will progress to chronic stages.</p> <strong>Secondarry syphilis:</strong> <p>Secondary syphilis is often marked by a skin rash that is characterized by brown sores about the size of a penny. The rash appears anywhere from three to six weeks after the chancre appears. While the rash may cover the whole body or appear only in a few areas, the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are almost always involved. Because active bacteria are present in these sores, any physical contact - sexual or nonsexual - with the broken skin of an infected person may spread the infection at this stage. The rash usually heals within several weeks or months. Other symptoms also may occur, such as mild fever, fatigue, headache, sore throat, as well as patchy hair loss, and swollen lymph glands throughout the body. These symptoms may be very mild and, like the chancre of primary syphilis, will disappear without treatment. The signs of secondary syphilis may come and go over the next one to two years. </p><p>If untreated, syphilis may lapse into a latent stage during which the disease is no longer contagious and no symptoms are present. Many people who are not treated will suffer no further consequences of the disease. Approximately one-third of those who have secondary syphilis, however, go on to develop the complications of late, or tertiary, syphilis, in which the bacteria damage the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones, joints, or almost any other part of the body. This stage can last for years, or even for decades. </p> <strong>Late syphilis:</strong> <p>Late syphilis, the final stage, can result in mental illness, blindness, other neurologic problems, heart disease, and death.  </p><strong>Neurosyphilis:</strong> <p>Syphilis bacteria frequently invade the nervous system during the early stages of infection, and approximately 3 to 7 percent of persons with untreated syphilis develop neurosyphilis. Some persons with neurosyphilis never develop any symptoms. Others may have headache, stiff neck, and fever that result from an inflammation of the lining of the brain. Some patients develop seizures. Patients whose blood vessels are affected may develop symptoms of stroke with resulting numbness, weakness, or visual complaints. In some instances, the time from infection to developing neurosyphilis may be up to 20 years. Neurosyphilis may be more difficult to treat and its course may be different in people with HIV infection.</p><h3>How to treat it?</h3> Primary syphilis or syphilis of less than one year duration: Benzathine  penicillin G - 2.4 million units by injection or oral doxycycline  100mg twice a day or tetracycline 500mg four times a day for 2 weeks.  Syphilis infections of greater than one year duration or of unknown  duration: Benzathine penicillin G - 2.4 million units by injection  weekly for 3 weeks or either of the above oral medications for four  weeks duration. A penicillin derivative is still the drug of choice,  but doxycycline or tetracycline works well for penicillin-allergic  individuals. No matter what type of syphilis you have, a critical  treatment step is notification of all of your sexual partners. They  must also be treated. <br /> <h3>Will Syphilis recur?</h3> Having syphilis once does not protect a person from getting it again.  Following successful treatment, people can still be susceptible to  re-infection. Only laboratory tests can confirm whether someone has  syphilis. Because syphilis sores can be hidden in the vagina, rectum,  or mouth, it may not be obvious that a sex partner has syphilis. Talking  with a health care provider will help to determine the need to be  re-tested for syphilis after treatment has been received.  <h3>Myths dispelled</h3> Here are some facts to clear up some common misconceptions.  <ul> <li>Syphilis was probably not brought to the New World by Columbus's crew.</li> <li> Even though your chancre goes away without treatment, you are not cured.</li> <li>You cannot catch syphilis from toilet seats or in gyms or swimming pools (unless you're doing more than laps).</li> </ul><h3>Prevention</h3> <p> <em>In response to recent increases in newly identified HIV cases seen by Public Health STD providers and continuing, disturbing trends locally in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), community leaders have joined with Public Health to encourage gay and bisexual men to take a more active role in promoting their health and the health of their community through testing, disclosure of HIV status and condom use. </em></p><p>  Abstinence from sexual activity is the surest way to avoid becoming infected with syphilis--not having any anal, oral or vaginal sex.  The next surest way is to limit sex to one uninfected partner who only has sex with you--mutual monogamy. See our section on <a class=""slink"" onclick=""javascript: openWindow('9_10_3','400','400','negotiatedsafety',20); return false;"">negotiated safety</a> for other ways to protect yourself and your partner. For those choosing to be sexually active outside longstanding, permanent relationship, condoms should be used correctly and consistently to minimize transmission. </p> <ul> <li> Avoid sex if suspicious symptoms are present. If you think you could have syphilis(or any STD), seek immediate care at a local STD clinic, hospital, or medical practitioner. </li> <li> Before having sex, talk with your partner(s) about syphilis and other STDs. Work out a risk reduction strategy with them that feels comfortable to both of you. </li> <li> If you have syphilis (or any STD), notify all sex partners so that they can also seek and obtain treatment. If you feel that you cannot tell your sex partners, public health can help notify them. In the Anchorage area, ask to speak to any disease intervention specialist.</li> </ul> <p> Although a condom greatly reduces the risk of syphilis infection, it must be worn from the start of close physical contact. </p> <p>If your partner has a chancre at the base of his shaft, scrotum or pubic hair, a condom will probably not protect you. The spirochete is extremely sensitive to drying and is easily killed with soap and water. Heterosexual couples in the United States are often routinely tested for syphilis as part of a marriage license procedure; gay couples, however, are presently denied the right to marry and thus often do not undergo a syphilis test. As part of prevention, we must routinely ask for syphilis screening. </p> <p>The chancre most often appears on or close to the glans (head) of your penis. It can also be further down the shaft or on the scrotum. If you have anal syphilis, the chancre might be inside your anal opening, making it hard to spot. In these instances, the chancre might be confused with an anal fissure. In fact, some men have even mistakenly had surgery when antibiotics would have cured the problem.  </p> <p>Syphilis may be harder to diagnose in people with HIV or other immune compromised individuals who do not make antibodies to the infection. In other words, they may have syphilis despite a negative blood test. Your risk for catching or passing HIV when you have syphilis is two to five times greater.</p><h3>Being HIV Positive</h3> <p>Syphilis may be harder to diagnose in people with HIV or other immune compromised individuals who do not make antibodies to the infection. In other words, they may have syphilis despite a negative blood test. Your risk for catching or passing HIV when you have syphilis is two to five times greater.</p> <h3>Incubation period</h3> A chancre develops within 90 days; the average times it takes to develop  is two to four weeks. It heals within three to eight weeks, and if  untreated, secondary syphilis begins. If syphilis is still not treated,  tertiary syphilis may begin 10 to 20 years later. <br /> <h3>Sex</h3> A condom may not protect you, especially if your partner has a chancre  on the base of his shaft or on his scrotum. Chancres of the anus or  vagina can be extremely difficult to spot. <br /> <h3>Prevalence</h3> <p>There were more than 40,000 cases of syphilis in the United States last year, and more than half represented men who have sex with men. After steady declines in the 1990s, syphilis rates increased in 2003 for the third year in a row. Syphilis continues to drop among African-Americans and women, but rates soared among men who have sex with men - who accounted for about 60 percent of the nation's 7,082 cases last year, said Dr. Hillard Weinstock, of CDC's National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention. The increase among gay men is partly attributed to AIDS prevention fatigue and new HIV drugs; it also may be fueled by methamphetamine use and using the Internet to meet sex partners, said Douglas.</p> <p> Douglas said the goal of eliminating syphilis will not be achieved by 2005, at least among gay men. He added that new strategies must be developed to target gay men who perceive themselves at less risk for HIV and therefore lower their guard about safe sex.</p> <p> United States has the highest rate of syphilis of any industrialized nation The vast majority of cases in the U.S. occurred in Southern states (anyone want to move North?). Men who have sex with men and people in lower socioeconomic groups have a higher rate of syphilis infection. </p><h3>Relationship to Internet/Bathhouses </h3><p>Researchers  at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services found that  many MSM who were diagnosed with syphilis met their sexual partners  online or at commercial sex venues. In one study, 22 percent of 587  MSM diagnosed with early syphilis in Los Angeles had met one or more  sexual partners on the Internet around the time that they were most  likely infected. Two-thirds of study participants who met sex partners  on the Internet were co-infected with HIV. Another study found that  28 percent of 658 MSM diagnosed with early syphilis in Los Angeles  met one or more sexual partners in commercial sex venues, such as  bathhouses and sex clubs. Those who reported meeting partners in these  venues were also twice as likely to have HIV infection.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p>",STDs & ConditionsInterpretation of test results,"<h3>A positive result means: </h3><ul> <li>You are HIV-positive (carrying the virus that causes AIDS).  </li><li>You can infect others and should try to take precautions to prevent doing so.
